“These ar en’ t the dr oids y ou’ r e looking for”
- Obi-W an Kenobi, Star W ars: A New Hope
2019 - I can't r emember the month.
T he room w as cold and dark. Presenters filed on and off  stag e . W e sat at the “cool kids”
table for business o wners who had softw are o v er $10,000,000 ARR (ann ual recur ring rev en ue). W e
felt g ood about ourselv es . Our softw are company ALAN had recently crossed $1,700,000 per mo
threshold in its first six months .
As w e c hatted betw een speak ers , the ev ent host g ot on stag e . “Our next speak er is someone
ev er y one should pa y close attention to . T his man is responsible for o v er $50 billion in sales ." T he
noise in the room quieted. T he host contin ued, “...He is a specialist in pricing and profit
maximization. He w ork ed for years at Vista, one of  the most reno wned softw are pri v ate equity funds
in the w orld. ”
Gul p . Reality chec k. I'm still a minnow .
T he speak er brok e do wn the process Vista used to g ro w companies . T heir method w as
unlik e any I had heard. Here's ho w it w ork ed.
W hen they consider acquiring a company , they analyze the company's cur rent customers .
T hey look for the customers who sta y the long est and pa y the most. T hen, they score them
according to this v alue . T he highest scores g o to the customers w or th the most, the lo w est to the
ones w or th the least. If  they feel there's a v ein of  underser v ed v aluable customers , they buy the
company .
Once they buy a company , they'd cut c hannels that brought the lo w v alue customers . T hen,
they double do wn on the c hannels that brought in the best ones .
T hat’ s it. More of  the high profit customers . F ew er lo w profit customers . Rinse . R e peat.
W hen he brok e do wn the math, it became ev en more ob vious . It w as P areto's principle
(80/20) on steroids . T w enty percent of  customers bring in eighty percent of  rev en ue . If  y ou re place
the eighty percent with those high spenders , y ou g ro w the business 5x. No small feat, especially in
billion dollar companies . I w ondered ho w I could apply this method across our por tfolio . Since then,
it's become a pillar of  our v alue acceleration method (V AM) at acquisition.com

Finding the Right Customer s
Earlier , I talk ed about pic king the right mark et. It's an impor tant strategic business decision.
Choosing the perfect a v atar is a subset of  that larg er decision. T his is where w e become more
n uanced about exactly who w e ser v e , and more impor tantly ,
w ho w e do not
.
T here are four ste ps to installing this process . I outline them belo w . T hen, I share what w e
found after implementing this in Gym Launc h. Here are the ste ps .
1)
Sur v ey y our customers
: Set up a for m with the questions
belo w and send it out. Or , for
higher eng ag ement, g o o v er it with them li v e at an ev ent or on a call. Mak e sure they sho w
they completed it to recei v e some benefit. Ask them ev er y relev ant detail y ou’ d w ant to
kno w . Here’ s an example of  questions I w ould ask business ser vices customers:
a)
Demo graphics
: W ho are they? Ag e? Gender? P olitical
affiliation? Geog raphic location?
Digital Location? Single/Di v orced? P ar tnered in business or solopreneur?
b)
Business Stats Befor e & Cur r ent
: R ev en ue? Profit,?
# of  emplo yees? Chur n? Pricing?
Products? Customer lifetime v alue? # of  customers? Nic he? Ho w long in business?
c)
Aspirations
: W hat w as their g oal upon purc hasing y our
ser vices/products? W hat
problem w ere they tr ying to solv e?
d)
Buying Pr ocess
: W hat's the single big g est reason they
bought? W as there a trig g er ev ent
that caused them to buy? Did they consume any specific piece of  content? W as there
a specific testimonial they consumed? Ho w many pieces did they consume? W hen
did they first hear about y ou vs when they bought? W here did they first see us? Did
someone refer them?
2)
Find y our big g est spenders
: Sor t the re plies b y the
customers y ou lik e the most, spent the
most, and sta yed the long est. F ocus on the top 20%. Ignore the rest.
3)
See what they ha v e in common
: T his tak es reading through
all the answ ers and using y our
brain. I kno w . T hinking is hard. T he g ood news is - y our competitors w on ’ t do it - easy
adv antag e . Goal: Come up with the few est qualifiers they all ha v e in common. No w , list
them out. Usually there are three to fi v e qualifiers .
4)
Ex ecute
: Once y ou ha v e these answ ers y ou’ re g oing
to do tw o impor tant things .
a)
Speak y our new a v atar .
Be upfront about y our customer
requirements . Get all
adv er tising to speak directly to them. Y ou will re pel the bad customers and attract
the g ood ones . Stop selling any one who does not meet y our ideal customer

requirements . Seriously , stop it. T hen, increase effor t on the c hannels these people
come through
b)
R e-engineer T he Sales Process . Look at what caused these better customers to buy .
R ev erse-engineer the buying process y our best customers w ent through. T hen, mak e
it happen on pur pose .

Findings fr om steps 1-3 a bout our best customer s:

Aspirations
: $1M+ g ym, not w ork so m uc h, open more

Buying R easons
: Not enough leads , “bad mark et”, bad
pricing, can ’ t find g ood emplo yees
Step 4a: New R edefined A v atar
:
W e sur v eyed our customers
to see what the top 20
percent had in common. In other w ords , w e g ot to see what our most successful customers
look ed lik e .
Actions:
W e focused on the audiences
that had the highest concentration of
these types of  g ym o wners . W e spelled out our requirements in our ads and pag es . W e talk ed
only about the specific problems and aspirations of  our best customers , rather than
all
customers .
Findings fr om step 1-3 a bout ho w they bought:
After looking at the data, w e found that 78% of  our top customers had consumed

g ot on the phone with someone who had not done that, our c hances of  selling them w ere
lo w er .
Step 4b: R ev er se-engineer buying pr ocess. Actions:
My team then recreated this “ideal”
buying experience . F rom this point onw ards , w e injected tw o long for m high v alue content
pieces to eac h lead as a par t of  their buyer jour ney . And, w e increased our total output of
content. On top of  that, w e created a list of  our “all time g reatest hits” of  content to ar m the
sales team. T hey then hand select tw o to three pieces they think could help the prospect. By
doing that, they
for ced
them to g o through the same
buying process that caused our best
customers to buy . Note: T hey w ere
not
disguised sales
pitc hes , they w ere g en uinely
v alue-in-adv ance content. (Lik e this , hopefully).
A Comparison
A while bac k, I considered buying an equity stak e in a business ser vices company that ser v ed
fitness business o wners . I spent the mor ning with the business o wner lear ning about his business
metrics . F rom speaking with him, I disco v ered that despite the o wner ser ving the same v er tical as
me ,
and
making the same n umber of  total sales , he
w as making 70x
less
profit (yes , sev enty times
less!) Spoiler : it w asn ’ t because w e’ re brilliant. It’ s because figuring out the most v aluable customers
to sell to w orks .
T he difference
. T hey acce pted any one with a pulse
and a credit card. As a result, they dealt
with high customer c hur n, high costs of  acquisition, lo w retention rates , and lo w er satisfaction
scores . And it had to be that w a y . Compared to ours , their advice w as g eneric . On the other hand, w e
selecti v ely pursued and catered to the highest v alue customers . W e ignored all others . T his g a v e us
higher retention, higher g ross margins , premium pricing, and lots of  re peat business . Same mark et.
Different customer segmentation. Monstrously different results . T his stuff  matters .
Quality > Quantity
Many competitors tr y to recreate our buyer jour ney . Ho w ev er , they don ’ t fully commit. T hey
panic , then cut out ste ps to g et more v olume . T his is often a mistak e . In m y experience , ev er ytime
w e remo v ed qualification ste ps , our lead v olume increased, but w e made less money . Merging
mark eting and sales into one acquisition de par tment solv ed this problem for g ood. Mark eting
stopped complaining that the sales team w asn't closing . Sales team stopped complaining that they

w anted more leads . Ev er y one came tog ether to focus on what mattered: closing lots of  v aluable
deals . W e no w use the optimal amount of  ste ps to g enerate the highest retur n on adv er tising
over the
long haul
.
Example: I w ould rather pa y $5000 to acquire $45,000 than pa y $1000 to acquire $5000
(e ven
though it costs fi ve times as much).
Kno wing y our ideal buyer jour ney forces patience . Y ou see the business holistically , rather
than as a widg et to be sold to as many people as possible . T he ladder is ho w small newbie
entre preneurs think - don't think lik e that.
T o gi v e some context, the a v erag e Gym Launc h competitor has an L TV of  around
$6000-$8000. I kno w because I’v e look ed at buying their businesses . Our L TV is nor th of  $45,000.
No w despite the L TV being *only* 6-8x higher , the subsequent margins that occur as a result are
breathtakingly different. F or a moment, I w ant y ou to imagine 8x y our price , and k ee ping y our costs
the same . Ho w m uc h more
pr ofit
w ould y ou be making?
Probably a lot. T hat’ s the difference .
Once y ou nar ro w do wn y our focus , y ou ser v e few er customers in the shor t ter m. T his ma y
mean a shor t team decrease in rev en ue (due to the cost of  c hang e). But o v er the long haul, y ou g et a
long ter m with higher retention and profitability . And unless y ou're planning on quitting business ,
wh y w ouldn ’ t y ou mak e the right long ter m call?

Y ou ha v e three actions to do at the end of  this c hapter
to g et more leads
. First, sur v ey y our
existing customers . Next, use this data to decide whic h c haracteristics are leading indicators of  high
v alue customers . Finally , use this infor mation to c hang e y our messaging in y our adv er tising, and
re-engineer a sales process for them specifically .
Ov er the long haul, this increases the quality and quantity of  y our lead f lo w . It also increases
y our a v erag e customer v alue as y ou are w eeding out all the less-than-qualified potential customers up
front.
Gro wing a business comes do wn to selling more customers or making them w or th more .
T his c hapter accomplishes both. Y ou g et more clients because y our mark eting becomes more
tailored. And, y ou mak e y our clients w or th more b y ex clusi v ely selling the highest v alue people . It
feels lik e c heating because it's so ob vious . But here’ s the g reat par t -
no one does it
. Getting this ste p
right will act as a force m ultiplier on the remaining contents in this book.
No w that w e kno w who w e are looking for? Is there any other w a y w e can scale our a v atar?
Shor t answ er - Y es . And w e will tac kle that on our next adv enture .
