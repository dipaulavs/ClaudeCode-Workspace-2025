TRANSCRIÇÃO:

With this update from Andromeda, the way you test creatives on Facebook Ads has completely changed. So in this video here I will show you the correct way to test your creatives and get results like this one. You can see that here I have several creatives, in total I have 13 creatives and all of them, almost all of them, there are some here that did not sell, but throughout the video I will talk about why some sold and others did not. But if you look at the vast majority of creatives, they sold, which is what matters. Of course, it's normal in a test some creatives don't sell and others sell, but when you have a method, when you have structure, when you know what you're doing, most of your creatives will sell. And that's exactly what I'm going to show you in this video. I'll even update it here for you to see that There's no cut or anything, I'll even look here, you see the values, invested 500, returned 1,300. This here, folks, is a creative test, it's not even the scale campaign that I teach in the other videos, this is just part of the test, I know a lot of people were in doubt about the creative test, and that's exactly what we're going to talk about here in this video. So here, guys, straight to the point, in this video here we're going to go through some parts to make the division clearer. First, I'll show you how to set up a structure, that is, a creative test campaign. Then I'll show you an example of a champion creative in practice, so you can model it, you'll be able to understand why that creative worked, then we will do a campaign in practice and finally I will show you how to make the creative champion because besides the structure to show you how a creative champion works I will show you how you do this creative ok but first I need you to understand some things the first thing is that always always the creative it will be there in the case 80/20 of the operation it is no use you have a super validated offer or a that hits the pain, that you know that it delivers everything the person needs, but you have bad creatives. Because when you have bad creatives, you don't sell, you can't wake people's curiosity, you can't make them continue and want to know more about that question of the offer, how can you solve the problem or then fulfill the desire of that person. So the creative is 80/20. Of course, a round offer is extremely necessary, but it also does not help at all. You have an incredible offer and you do not know how to make good creatives and you do not know how to do the test issue, ok? So this is very important and the first thing you have to do is what? First find your creative champions for you to then scale. Pay attention to this here, folks. You will never, never scale loss. So if you have a creative that you are testing and is not selling, you won't insist on that one. Go to the next one, don't get attached to the creative. It's not because you thought that creative was going to sell and didn't sell that you'll be insisting on it. No, if it's not selling, leave it aside, go test the next ones. You'll understand how to do it in this video here. So here we're going to talk a little bit about the structure, remembering that we're going to do this here in practice, okay? But I want you to understand what we're going to do Because if you just stay in that one of wanting to copy without understanding, you won't get results. So you can't be an amateur anymore, you really need to understand what's going on. So you'll come here, the structure we're going to use is a 1-1-1 structure, that is, a campaign and the budget will be here in the campaign. When we create the campaign, you will understand a set and a creative. because now with this new update from Andromeda, Facebook wants you to leave the control in his hand, he doesn't want you to keep messing with things that don't make any more sense. So here in all the tests I did, what am I doing? First I upload a creative test campaign there, putting a campaign, a set, a creative and then I go there for a scale when these creatives validate when it is a validated creative when it is a creative that sells if you want to understand more later there how to do this process of scale of a single campaign with several creatives that have some little things that you need there to pay attention I'll leave the video here on the card for you to watch later, ok? In the budget issue, what do I like to put? I like to always put at least the product ticket, because when you put the product ticket, you can make Facebook have more verbs to test. If you put a very limited budget, what will happen? He will not be able to find the buyer's audience there, he will not have enough money to go in several different slices. So, folks, this is paid traffic, you have to put money. There's no way you can try to do a campaign or a sale with 10, 20 reais. you have it, but this is not sustainable in the long term you need to put money so if the value of your product it costs here let's put here 50 reais you will put 50 reais if it costs 100 reais put 100 reais there but it's too much to put there is 100 reais that I said my product I will have to if I want to test there 10 creative have to do 10 different campaigns? Yes, it will give you a thousand reais. If it is a value that is heavy for you at the moment, then I recommend that you test less, at least two there at a time, or you decrease the value of your product, okay? You see what makes more sense to you. then come here the question of time I like to at least leave it from two to three days ok you can't do a test structure there leaving a day only first day very bad second day you can already have a notion of ideal two days because you are already investing a little higher value you are putting the value of the ticket so two days you can have a notion if that creative is good or not if it is a creative that goes forward or not ok and here we will always always test angles different angles what would be angles angles are forms of you presenting there your offer you present your solution there I put some angles here that I want you to test with validated angles that I know work ok I deliver these angles here within my training course that there I give more details I put more in depth here I'm just delivering you for you to start and start to collect your first results, but if you want to go even deeper into my methodology, understand how I do it, enter my mind and see my campaigns in real time, having access to my creatives, my products and also my support, along with my methodology, I'll leave my training here in the first link in the description, where I'll show you step by step, so you can learn paid traffic in the right way, which will put money in your pocket. What I see most is people investing and not having results, just throwing money away. So stop trying alone, stop hitting your head and come with someone who wants to help you. Who will take your hand and make you make money. That's what I say, just don't make money, who doesn't have a method, who doesn't have knowledge, who doesn't want to. Because I show step by step, I reveal everything, I don't hide anything. So if you want to have my help later, make you prosper in this wonderful market, just click on the first link in the description. So let's go, I'll show you some angles here and I'll show you a validated creative later. And within this validated creative, you will identify here which angle we are using. I'll even do an exercise here with you. I want you to think later which angle I'm using for the validated creative that I'm going to show you. The first angle here, in this case, is the angle of pain. bar problem I put here more or less a summary just for you to understand ok if you want to have access to this PDF here just follow me on Instagram Henrique Oliveira. Me and send me a word here that in this case is PDF without my Direct with automation will send you but it only works for those who follow me ok so it's important you follow me so here going back to the angle of pain and problem and the goal of this angle is to generate immediate identification of the person look with it there and see that you are with her. I'll give you an example here. He just moved away and you don't understand what happened? Do you feel that he doesn't look at you the same way anymore? So here are some examples of angles for you to use, okay? All the angles I'm going to show you here are within the relationship niche. The second angle here is the angle, in this case, of desire and transformation so this angle here of desire and transformation is one that I really like to use because it gives a lot of results you show the ideal result an example here he coming back wishing you again and his goal is to awaken hope and visualization of a dream with the examples imagine him calling you to talk saying he miss you yes it is possible to make him look at you as before even with more desire anyway here I have nine different angles I won't open one by one if it doesn't look like a giant one, ok So if you want to have access to these angles here later, just send me the word PDF without on my Instagram that you will have access to each one here is speaking right now I will show you a validated creative and I want you to tell me here in the comments what angle I used for this creative let's go I'll play here I was . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Now let's go here to Facebook Ads to show you how we're going to do the campaign in the creative test practice. So I'm going to come here in Create, come here in Sales, Continue, and here I'm going to put the name as Creative Test Facebook Ads.

If my product costs R$100, I'll put R$100. Here I'll put R$50 as an example. I'll leave it at R$25. Let's say my product is a low ticket of R$25. And here I won't change anything, I'll move on. Here I'll put as I'll leave it here as a website, I'll select my pixel, put the event of buying here and here guys it's important that your pixel is configured correctly, that you have made the conversion API and connected directly to the platform.

You will go down here, Here you will leave it for another day, I'll put 24 here and here you won't fill anything, I won't touch anything, the only thing you can do if you want is to give a suggestion of audience, let's say your audience is only women, you can give a suggestion of women here, that's it, the rest I don't touch anything, I leave it open, the positioning, I don't touch anything and come here and I'll put my creative here, so let's say it's the AD1 Then you can put the angle you are using. Angle of pain and problem. Let's say we'll be this one. Pain / Problem. and here you will put both the creative I recommend that you put creative in video, ok? It's more converting and also the copy here based on the same thing, that is, in the angle of pain and problem.

Come here, AD2, let me copy, I'll put here AD2 and AD2. Here in this case, AD2 is the desire for transformation. Then I'll put here, desire for transformation, AD2. Then I come here, AD3, AD3, I put here AD3, what is AD3? Educational belief break. and put here the educational belief gap D3 So each one will be a different creative, that is, a different angle, this here that I showed you is just the tip of the iceberg if you want to go deeper later understand exactly all the part there of how you do all the tests and how you structure your campaign how you do so that you can make a profit even if you have a low budget.
