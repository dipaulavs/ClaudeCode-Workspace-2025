TRANSCRIÇÃO:

the new message campaign on meta-ads that's right if you do message campaigns for WhatsApp Direct there stay with me in this video I'll show you the update of the metrandomid now and how you need to build your message campaigns there for you to continue having the result, right, the goal said that those who do not update will already start to feel the loss of result mainly because the fact that his artificial intelligence is already working to optimize the ads so if you you're ready you can be sure you'll have a very negative impact there before anything else subscribe here on the channel activate notifications so you don't miss any content I bring here without further ado let's go here to the screen of my computer I want to show you this in practice right I'm already here in the ad manager and this class here is for those who already use the ad manager is for those who already do campaigns in the ad manager because I'm going to show you here the practice of creating a new campaign if that is starting now in this universe I will recommend for you to watch other videos here on the channel where I explain a little more about the manager, right? There is a recent video here where I present the advertiser for you to know this incredible tool and be able to make your ads there. Let's go here then first thing you're going to do is click here on create and here on create you will choose either engagement campaign or sales campaign to make the WhatsApp message campaigns there what happens here the goal has become more and more intelligent so if you want to sell if you are able to build sales campaigns what I will recommend for you to use the sales campaign goal it is usually a little more expensive than the engagement campaign, but it brings a lot more results for you, so it's worth it for you to invest a little more here in the sales campaign. Why does this happen, right? Why does it bring more results? Because here it is a fund, that is, the goal is to get people who are ready to buy and will show your ad, since in the engagement campaign it will look for people who may even be ready to to buy most of the time they are curious people so in this concept you end up throwing a little money away because you will have a volume of lead sometimes bigger only that not all leads will be qualified for you to buy you will have to make a little more effort to convince them to buy from you I will teach you the engagement campaign because the structure is very simple and some ad accounts here in the sales campaign for messages to WhatsApp will ask for the pixel and if you don't have the pixel there it will complicate your life a little but think to me the structure is similar, so it's okay, what I'm going to teach you to apply here in the engagement campaign you would be able to apply here in the sales campaign with tranquility you will click here then continue will wait to load here will choose here for now manual campaign will click on advance and here now you will put the name of the campaign I will put here better message campaign and then what I will recommend for you here put the date you are creating this campaign for you to have control there in fact when you're building your campaign there the budget from now on in the Andromeda version you will leave it here in the budget in the campaign it is not recommended anymore to return the budget here to the level of the ad set, you can even try it but the goal itself already says that the consolidation of the budget at the campaign level will bring you more results and during this class here you will understand in fact you no longer need to put the budget at the joint level here in the budget at the campaign level you will put a budget here of more or less 20 to 50 reais for you to start for you to go through the first stages of learning I will recommend here for you at least 30 reais a day is a nice verb there you can start to have results and pay quietly because if you sell something that you don't make more than 30 reais talking to the person on WhatsApp to make a sale is not even worth a message campaign, right? Because sometimes it will work a lot there and there will be no result. So think that the goal he wants you to invest, he wants you to put money, bet with him here so you can really have more results. So the more you invest, the more results you will have. So if you can start with fifty reais here, you you can start I will not recommend you start a message campaign with more than 50 reais at the beginning because you will have a learning phase there that can be two to three days after you have the first results you like these results you can double the budget that's it yes you can leave the thing more on the autopilot here combined down here you don't need to move anything you will click here to move forward let's put the name of the set here right it will be public open I'll explain how we will build this public open here of the new version here now you will choose the page that you would like, ok And then there is a detail before here, here in the conversion site, check if you are sending messages, because some accounts come here, look at my ad, right, then you change here to send a message, then you will click here, you will choose the page that you would like, I will take my page here, the example character time then what I'm going to do here I'm going to disable all the functions here to send a message to Direct to message and I'll leave only WhatsApp here I recommend for you to leave WhatsApp or message if you want to announce for both at the same time make two campaigns because it will be better and you will have more control over your budget if the number you want to announce is not on the list here you can click here to add a number remembering that you will have to add a number of WhatsApp Business here or the official API for you to be able to run the ads if it's traditional WhatsApp you won't have the functionality to run the ads here you will let it maximize the number of conversations even no need to move here, there's a new one, a new function called value rule, write down this name and we'll come back here to talk about it, let's go down a little more here here at the expense limit, right here in the ad programming the end of the term at the beginning you don't need to move anything you can leave it the way it is here but what is the detail this is a special tip let's say if you are creating this ad right very close there I don't know from 7 at night 8 at night I recommend you come here and put the next day and here you can put it like 7 in the morning ok or 6 in the morning because that right promises to have a longer period to optimize your ad that is to understand who your audience is when by conversation and it ends up being better for you and makes your cost per message over the campaign time to be cheaper so if you're doing this campaign at night put it to run the next day in the morning because it will be better for you I like it here at 7 6 in the morning are nice hours here now the deadline you never put why you never put Every time you put a date of term here, the meta does the following. It understands the period you put. The artificial intelligence will understand which is the best day to show your ad. And then, instead of distributing your verb uniformly, it takes and puts days with a lot of verb, days with little verb. anyway, your budget gets kind of crazy, it can happen that your campaign stays the whole week without spending and on Friday spend all the budget, anyway, I don't like it, I prefer to leave it without marking the deadline and I control my budget during the campaign, it's much better and I have a lot more results, since in the public control you will put the region you want to announce this here is still quiet, so for example if I were to make an here for my region I could put the name of the city click here the pin still exists here so you can zoom in here, choose where your establishment is there, for example, imagine that it's in this corner here, right I'll come here, I'll put the pin here on the corner and I can configure the radius here that I want, that is leaving a much larger area for my ad to appear or even a small one here, one kilometer from my establishment. Remembering that I recommend rays here, if your city is very small, you put a 4-kilometer, 5-kilometer ray there so that the audience is not very limited, and consequently you have much less result. Another important thing here, at the minimum age, if you sell a product that is for people over 25 years old, people who tend to buy from you who are over 25 years old, you will come here and put more than 25 years, ok? Why is that? Because if you don't have an 18-year-old audience there, you don't sell to these people, you already limit it here, you eliminate a large percentage of the people who are, for example, on Instagram, he put this functionality here for us because on Instagram, mainly most people connect there are 18 to 25 years old so when he makes this limitation here I take all the public teenager we have to pay attention to this one, you will leave the ads included here in the discovery there WhatsApp is this here is a new feature So what does this mean here in practice that your ads will now appear on WhatsApp too, so you've already started making ads there in the positioning update so when you come here on your WhatsApp, look at the update, your ads can appear here from now on, right? So it was really cool, it's another positioning we have there to be able to impact our client and increase the result if you have a list of buyers, those people who have already bought from you and you don't want to impact these people again, you come here and go up this list, right? Come here, click here and do the list of buyers that you don't want to impact or any other audience you want to exclude, but if you don't have it, don't don't worry about it because it's not that important since in the public Advent you will leave it like this here ok you won't move it will leave it automated here the way it is here because this will increase your results even more in some ad accounts don't even call more public Advent and say so, suggest a public, right? So it's very suggestive, it won't make big changes when you give a suggestion of public here since in the positions you can leave them automated too, that the goal itself to decide where you will show your ad to get more results for you this is very important to stay automatic also because when it's automatic here you have the chance to chase the customer in several positions so the goal can show your ad on direct then on the feed then on Facebook then on WhatsApp anyway until the person clicks and talks to you so you can leave it here fixed in this way I talked to you about the value rule, right, let's talk a little bit here now about this new feature not so new but now it's starting to be mandatory for us to think about using the value rule more often here in the value rule I can create rules so that I speak and promise who is my ideal customer and that I am willing to pay for it finally the goal will show my ad in a comprehensive way obviously using artificial intelligence to understand who has the most tendency to buy my product or service only I can still say goal I know you're good at what you do but I want to give a kick here I'm willing to pay a little more for my pick in this context you will click here will come here create the rules right here you don't create the rules it lets you do up to 10 rules only the ideal here is one or two rules is enough one of the rules that I recommend for you is to come here in criteria right age for example if you know that the audience who buys from you for example is 25 to 34 years old you will enable here if you know it's 35 to 44 years old you will enable here you can even enable two but I prefer to enable only one if you know that your audience has a predominance of sex, that is, there are more men, more women, you come here and do the same thing, select an age that buys you the most, then here you will put how much you are willing to pay for this lead, that is, for this contact, no goal imagine there let's go here in practice for you to understand imagine that a regular customer who clicks on the message campaign to talk to you who does not fit the rules and that the goal did not see the need to stand out another person in the auction to show your ad costs five reais only then you and João are announcing this lead costs five reais the goal show you now in the order of the auction it would be time to show João only you said you're willing to pay fifty percent more expensive so what he's going to do instead of showing João he's going to show you and he's going to charge you 750 for this lead and not only that João would pay what happens in practice here, right, you have more chances of appearing for the ideal customer, the one want to buy from you only you need to know who this client is, right? And then you need to study your persona well, study your ideal client well so you can build it here correctly and consequently have much more results if you don't know your ideal client, it's no use playing with this functionality, imagine if I want to pay only twenty percent more expensive here, so let's put twenty percent here, let's click on advance, let's put the name of the rule here, I'll put men here 35 44 years old I'm going to click here to create so I created the rule the goal will focus on that because I'm applying a rule here when it comes to showing my ad it even recommends more rules currently ok than you use here the public Advantage or classic segmentation here or in the saved public here you will click here to move forward now and we will configure your ads for that you're doing there and pay attention to me now in this part of the ad setting this completely changed the way to do it here and if you don't do it the right way you can be sure you're going to throw a lot of money out what I want you to understand the goal from now on he's asking us to build ads with independent and unique creative concepts and also independent and unique creative formats as this works in practice let's go here this graph here which is a screen including of the goal itself, it exemplifies for us how the analysis of the creatives is now, the identification of the creatives and their sampling in the auction, that is, which creative that the goal will identify. Imagine the scenario here that all these creatives that are here on the side are the creatives that you uploaded in your ad set, right? So there are several creatives, but what what happens imagine that all the roses they are small variations imagine that the roses are the same art you just changed the background color imagine that the blues are the same is the same title you just changed the photo imagine that the purple ones are the same concept you just changed the order of the video but the message was the same the goal will analyze these contents independently and will compare them so he will understand that all those pink creatives are the same things the blue ones are the same things and the purple ones are the same things so it's no use going up for example here, several creatives because in the end there will be little for this not to happen what do you have to do in practice, right, you'll have to come here and follow the order that I'm going to draw the creatives here with you now to build your ads but before I want to talk to you about this panel and then we start to duplicate here for you to understand the structure you have to use from now on in your messages campaigns there so okay here you will keep it this way here on top of this way here you can choose posts that you have already posted on your feed as long as they are different, right So it has to have different lines different content will increase your result but it doesn't need to be posted you can just have them on the computer and choose here to create an ad is that it is basically the dark post right where you will choose this ad on your computer very nice to use here you will be able to use images videos and you will also use carrossels here now come here with me one of the biggest changes that have been like this was the following from now on I can mix in the same set of images video carrossel anyway any type of creative I can put it in the same set of ads this is very good for us because I don't need to be separating anymore because in the past how it worked, right, the goal is always that I put a video an image in the same set for the video to have more engagement it ended up delivering more of my video than my image, right, this consequently affected the campaign because sometimes the video didn't sell as much as the image now no he can read the creative concept of your ad and understand if that client is ideal to see the image a video a carousel or even by the time of purchase that that client is and if that client is closer to buying it will show a more background ad of the funnel than a top of the funnel ad this makes it easier for us there and makes us more and more so stay calm there because this is a very good change and it will enhance your results there too let's go back here to the screen right now you understand that you can upload any type of creative here now here in the creative create you can come here to choose the image or video if you go get your computer if you change here to you will simply select it there on your Instagram or Facebook, it's down here now we'll have this one, you don't need to move the creative test, it's this one I strongly believe that it will be discontinued soon, even because it asks for several creatives to go up, so it doesn't make sense to want to test more here, look at the messages you can click here to edit and customize the message here according to each creative to make it unique and you to see which creative is bringing more conversations to you because in some cases the avatar of the creative that is leading the conversation to you does not appear , so I like to activate the messages here, this greatly improves my result, agreed? Let's go now, let's talk about the diversity of creative, Meta asked you to come here and duplicate by campaign, he is recommending that you use something around 20 creative. I'm going to make a lot of creative here is this one how I'm going to be able to do this amount of creative come here with me in these creative ones here you will make variations ok so here for example I can have a creative let's put it here this creative here is a unique image that is, it's a unique photo I made it, but this image or unique art, what is its goal? It's an art, let's call it top of the funnel. What does that mean, Felipe? It means that this art here is for those clients who don't know me yet, who are lost, who don't know that I sell what I sell. to help me, the goal is to convince people to buy from me. The top of the funnel is to discover, it is for the goal to be able to show you and bring the client to you. Because what is the logic now? The goal will want to make creative pinpoints. So it will show a top art, a middle art and a bottom of the funnel art and will lead the person to talk to you or lead the person to buy from you. So you need to have discovery art, art of the middle and art of the bottom of the funnel I explain these creative concepts very well within the expert Edson is so there is already an updated version of this new version of the platform of Andromeda and explains about creative concepts I will explain about sales funnel content funnel where we will have half top and bottom of the funnel for you to you can better combine your creatives so you can sell more then I can have here now in this image below a single image of a funnel email that is a funnel email thing, right? It's an art, for example, where I already tell the person that I have a solution for her, I can have a funnel background, it can be here, for example, a discount, a guarantee, things that I will convince the person to buy from me, then I can have it here now in the place of image So I can have video here top of the funnel, I can have video here middle of the funnel, I can have video here bottom of the funnel and I can have several contents. I could have here now, let's paste it again here, a carousel. A top, middle and bottom of the funnel carousel. Then I can have a different carousel from each other. I can have a different video from each other. I can have a different image from the other and I'm going to do these creative variations so that I can fill in all the ads I need to have Felipe I can't have 20 ads today what do I do put the maximum you can you can even test it, right, take the old ads you have all the videos all the images carousels put everything together put it in your generator and see what happens sometimes it's good but this is just a test until you can organize yourself to build in the right order, so from now on you need to study campaigns you need to understand a little more about marketing mainly what is top, middle and bottom of the funnel you need to understand also of creative concepts, right What are creative concepts is basically the way you build your ads there are other videos here on the channel where I explain to you this drawing here so watch the old videos here on the channel where you will understand this drawing here and it will be clearer for you the way you can build your ads from now on it wasn't harder it was even easier because after you can scale you don't have to move a lot the campaign but it's obvious, right, all the change it brings with it a need for adaptation and this adaptation is not always easy so stay calm do it calmly but understand that from now on you need to do this that I'm talking about here and here now what are you going to do after you've built all your creatives you come here click on publish after you publish you will leave this ad running there is for more or less this ad like this this campaign running for about four or five days for you to be able to see which creatives are really giving results the creatives that are delivering more results great there will be those who will not delivering no result for you. In the past, those who were not delivering the result, we paused. Now we leave them there the same way. After seven, ten days, if they continue not delivering the result, what do you do? You change the creatives within the set of ads. Those who are not delivering the result. This we have the possibility of the goal to understand that it is the new creative and upload it to start delivering sometimes it can be even better than what was being delivered so the optimization now is no longer simply duplicate the campaign, right, it's basically you improve the campaign so that the goal can deliver you more now in this new version is the moment we have less campaigns to have result instead of how it was before, right, we had 20, 30 campaigns to get a cool result, agreed?
