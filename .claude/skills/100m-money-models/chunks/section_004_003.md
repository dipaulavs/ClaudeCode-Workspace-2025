Which one do you think will get you the best r esults?
June 2014.
John, another early mentor , retired early . He spent his retirement raising
his girls, playing golf, and hanging out at his lake house. He was a man who
had lived.
Once in a while, he’d invite me to his lake house. And on those long
drives, he taught me things about life and business that I use to this day.
Like the differen ce between price and value. The pros and cons of low-cost
offers. High-vo lume, low-pric e business models. Differenc es between
recurring subscriptions and one-time transactions. And the art of keeping
things simple  in business and life.
John was great company . I often  wished we could drive forever so I could
soak everything in. To him, this was just another story to pass the time. But
to me, it was a lesson I would never for get:
The 5-Day $5 VIP  Tanning Pass .
“You see, the beauty of the 5-Day Pass is everyone thinks they can get tan
in five days. And they can. But, it’s never as tan as they want to get. And if
they try to ‘speed things up’... they’ll burn. So, when someone comes in
with a pass, we ask them how tan they wanna get. As soon as they say they
want to get a few shades darker , we give them ‘the turkey talk’.”
“What’ s the turkey talk?” I asked.

John smiled and continued. “Say a Thanksgiving turkey takes three hours
to cook. We all know what happens if you double the temperature to cook it
in half the time—you burn it! It takes at least five to ten sessions to get the
color they want without burning . And since they gotta take some time
between session s, it always takes more than five days. Once they realize
that we say:
“‘Let’ s just credit your VIP pass towar d your first month. Why buy so
many $25 day passes when members get unlimited access for just $19.99?’
“They immediately see the value and take the membership. Easy as that.”
Five years later…
“Hey boss, we’ve got a problem.”
Oh boy… “What’ s up?” I said.
“Our fitness leads have gotten way too expensive. The guys who can sell
are still making it work, but most of them are barely breaking even.”
“Dang, so it finally happened,” I said. I pressed my hands to my forehead.
I knew this was coming. And the truth is, I was dreading it.
I tried for weeks to put a “spin” on our previous offer. A new or
interesting twist would buy us time, but our tests so far fell flat. Crap .
“You got any more of fers up your sleeve?” he asked.
I racked  my brain then remembered the $5 VIP Tanning pass. That just
might work. “Why don’t we offer something super cheap to get the leads,
but when they come in, make them a crazy offer that costs more but is 100x
better . They can still take the cheap thing, but we’ll just explain that they’ll
get way better results with extra accountability , nutrition, etc.”
“Yea, I can run something like that.”
A few weeks later…
“Alex, I think we cracked it.”
“Awesome! Walk me through it.”
“So we give two options. The first option is free. I give one session per
week. The second option is an ‘Ultimate’  Version for $399. It comes with
unlimited sessio ns, 1–1 coaching, more personalized stuff, and a guarantee
they’ll get results or they repeat the program for free...”
“Oh man…that guarantee is solid . What’ s the take rate?”
“We got about eight out of ten people to take the $399 option. We’re
crushing it.”

“Awesome—let’ s scale it!”

John was a brilliant salesman and patient teacher . His philosophy of
giving customers what they want now, so you can give them what they need
later shaped many ways I do business . He also inspired the offer that saved
my gym. But the most valuable thing I learned from him was: “You have to
know what gets results for customers better than they do. This makes our
premium offer the clear solution.” And making our premium the clear
solution is what Decoy Of fers are all about.
Description
Decoy Offers advertise somethi ng free or discounted. Then, when leads
ask to learn more, you also present a more valuable premium offer. The
premium offer provides more features, benefits, bonuse s, guarantees, and so
on. By putting your decoy offers and premium offers side-by-side, leads can
see how much more valuable your premium offer is. I like Decoy Offers
because they get more customers overall. They either take the decoy version
or the premium  version. If they take the premium, great. If they take the
decoy , also great. It gives you time to upgrade them rather than losing them.
But either way, you can close everyone. This makes it cheap and profitable
to get new customers. And any business can use it.
Here are the steps to make a Decoy Of fer:
1. Advertise a lesser, smaller, or simpler version of your premium
offer as a decoy.
2. When leads engage, offer both options, but emphasize the
premium one.

Examples
Lemonade Stand Offer  (Physical Pr oducts)
Attraction Offer: “Free Week of Lemonade” OR “$1 Week of
Lemonade.”
Decoy Option : “You can have this water + powdered lemon + corn
syrup” Or…
Premium Option : “The organic, all-natural, vegan, gluten-free, imported
Italian lemons, which are cold-processed and shipped straight  to your
door. You’ll never need to waste time coming to the store again. It’ll
have you feeling  like a labrador puppy chasing butterflies all day. It also
comes with other flavors, like our sparkling rosewater lemonade.”
Float Tank Center  (Service)
Attraction Offer : “Free 6-Week Stress Release” OR “$6 6-Week Stress
Release.”
Decoy Option : One float per month with at-home do it yourself stress
relief exercises.
Premium Option : Two times per week floats for 6 weeks, 1–1
consulting, journal, sleep routine. Satisfaction guaranteed.
Gym Offer  (Local Business)
Attraction Offer : “Free 21-Day Transformation” OR “$21 21-Day
Transformation.”
Decoy Option : Workouts done in a Skool.com group once a day. A
general nutrition plan. Can watch recordings. No support. No guarantee.

Premium Option : Unlimited workouts, a personalized nutrition plan, 1–
1 accountability , results guaranteed (or you get another 21 days free).
Important Notes
How To Make Your Decoy Offer . Offer fewer components, older models,
or fewer personalized versions of your premium offer. Also, remove any
guarantees. Your Attraction Offer only has to get leads to engage. Nothing
more.
Advertise Benefits Not The Featur es. We want to sell them on the dream
outcome . We advertise a transformation  in 21 days, not workouts and meal
plans. Leads get specific product details in the sales presentation,  not in the
advertising! Private jets and rowboats can both get you to an exotic island,
but the premium option is certainly more enjoyable.
You Can Advertise Discounts in Four  Ways. Let’s say you had a year-
long thing that costs $100 per month. If you wanted to let them pay $900
for the year , you could say:
1. Percentage Off: 25% off
2. Absolute Amount: $300 off
3. Free Portion: 3 Months Free
4. The Total Package: One Year For $900 ($1,200)
They all mean the same thing. It’s worth testing to see which one converts
better in your market.
Make The Contrast Huge . The value of the premium option comes from
huge differences with the decoy option. So make the decoy option as basic
as reaso nable. Then make the premium option as awesome as possible. The
bigger the contrast, the better the deal , and the more customers will take it.
Discount Offers  Have Higher  Show-Up Rates Than Free Offers. In my
experience, If you run a Free Attraction offer, you’ll get more leads. If you
run a Discount Offer, you’ll get fewer leads, but a higher percentage will
show up. So if you have low show-up rates for appointments, try a Discount
Offer instead. This is especially  important for businesses where you have a
high cost of someone not showing up (think doctors, lawyers, dentists, etc).
If Possible, Present The Premium Offer  First.  In a perfect world, they
take the premium offer immediately . The decoy offer stays in your back

pocket. If they come in specifically asking for the decoy option up front…
Get Them To Give You Permission To Sell Them. If they ask to hear
about your decoy , you are legally required to present it, or you prefer to
present it first, here’ s how I like to do it:
Ask them a simple question: “Are you here for free stuff or lasting
results?”
And as soon as they say “results,” which most people do, skip to your
premium of fer.
If they say “free  stuff,” present the decoy offer then immediately contrast
it with your premium offer. Then only after presenting both, ask them
“which do you think will get you to your goal faster?”  or “which would you
prefer: XXX less valuable benefit or YYY more valuable benefit 1, 2, 3…?”
At this point, they’ll have to say the premium offer. Then you can move
forward in the sale mutually agreeing it’ s the best thing for them.
When Making Your Premium Offer , Get Excited About It. Present it as
superior to the decoy offer, because it is. And, assuming it is, how it fits the
customer better . Your excitement motivates people to take the options that
will give them the most value.
From a selling perspective, you want to talk to the lead as if you already
know they will accept your offer. Many salespeople refer to this as an
“assumed close. ” You operate from a position of: This is what everyone
does. This is just a formality . Let me get your ID and credit card so you can
get your value. No hype. Just friendly disposition. Almost bored over how
regularly people buy .
Surprise Benefit (Optional) . To take this a step further , if someone takes
the decoy option, you can choose to surprise them with a few low-/zero-cost
features from your premium offer. Just say something like “hey, I’m gonna
throw this in, even though it’s part of our premium offer just because I want
you to get great results.” This builds goodwill, over delivers, and increases
the chance they take your upsells later . Remember—they’re still leads!
Summary Points
Decoy Offers advertise something free or discounted. Then, when
leads ask to learn more, you also present a more valuable premium
offer.

Make the premium option far more valuable than the decoy option
by adding more features, benefits, bonuses, and guarantees.
Strip down your Decoy Offer as much as reasonable.
When leads ask about your Decoy Offer, present your premium
offer right next to it.
Ask “are you here for free stuff or lasting results?” for permission
to offer the premium thing first.
You can still make money from leads who pick the decoy option.
You’ll learn the best way to deliver your decoy product and
maximize upsells from it.
Expect to make money fast. If you’re not, then make the contrast
between offers larger.
