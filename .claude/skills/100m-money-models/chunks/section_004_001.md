June 2013.
I was in a room full of experien ced gym owners, and I was the new guy.
We all took turns talking about what was working well. That’ s when Danny
piped up.
“Yea…so as you guys know , I’ve been struggling with sales…an d I think
I got it figured  out. I had this pain in the butt guy who wouldn’ t buy
anything . He knew he needed it but he also said he needed more
accountability . So we were going back and forth, and finally he came up
with this idea. He said, ‘How about this: I give you $500. You train me for
eight weeks. And if I hit my goal, I get my money back. But in return, you
can use my r esults to market your business. Fair enough?’”
“So…what happened?” I asked.
Danny replied, “I figured he wasn’ t gonna buy anyways, so I sold him.”
“Okay , so what happened with the guy?”
“He hit the goal.”
“So did you give him his money back?”
“That’ s what you’d think, but he ended up using the money to buy more
training!”
“Seems decent enough. What about marketing his results?”
“Dude, marketing his before and after pictures brought in thirteen
referrals!”

“That’ s insane. Now we’re talking.”
“Yea, I know . I offer this to everyone now. The results are way better and
people love the offer. And all the free advertising they do for us gets their
friends and family to join too. I’m making more money than ever .”
***
This is the first time I ever saw an offer like this. I updated it over time,
but the core stayed the same: pay now with a chance to get your money
back later . I used it for private training, group training, private nutritio n
coaching, and group nutrition coaching. Once I saw how well it worked
with my current customers, I started putting the offer in my ads for new
customers. My cost of getting customers went way down and my leads
exploded!
Description
A Win Your Money Back Offer works like this. You set a goal for the
customer and tell them how to reach it. If they reach it, then they qualify to
get their money back or get it back as store credit.
This offer grew my gyms better than any other . It was also the first Grand
Slam Offer that Gym Launch  taught to gym owners. It has tons of
flexibility . So if you want to get more cash, get more customers, and get
them better results. Nothing beats it.
To ‘Win Your Money Back’  the person has three options: Get Results,
Take Actions, or both. And to make this work, you have to make the results
and actions  simple  to track.
Results:  Here, no matter what they do, if the customer gets the result, they
win their money back. For example: Making $X a month, Getting Y
customers, Losin g Z lbs etc. Basically , they bet on their own ability to reach
the goal.
Actions:  Here, you hold them accountable for doing  actions instead of
getting  results. No matter what results they get, if the customer does what
you ask, they win their money back. For example: attend all sessions, calls,
meetings, log progress, take pictures, do assigned homework, etc. Here,
they bet on their ability to follow dir ections.

Actions and Results:  Here, you hold customers accountable to following
directions and getting results. If they do both, they win their money back.
Often, people wanting to achieve a goal have too few skills to do it. Even if
they did bet on themselves, they’d fail. By setting a good goal for them and
showing how they reach it, they have a fighting chance. Here they bet on
their ability to follow directions and that your directions will get them the
result.
Bottom Line:  Customers put money down. If they do the stuff OR they
get the result OR both— they get it back as cash or stor e credit.

Important Notes
This offer has generated over $1 billion in sales industry-wide. It works. I
have made a lot of money with it. You can too.
Win Your Money Back Works With New, Curr ent, And Previous
Customers.  I like to use it with new customers because it offers the steepest
discount possible—100%. I like it with current customers because it mixes
them in with new customers. And I like to use it to get previous customers
back because bigger incentives get them to come back.
It Works Well With Stuff People Start And…Quit.  Like starting
businesses, learning new skills, losing weight, building fitness, beauty
regimes, self-care, time management, mental health management, etc. It
keeps motivation during the early pains of learning. To this day, I have
never seen a better way of setting up a program for results—a true win-win.
Don’t Worry. This Offer  Makes Money . If you did give all the money
back, this offer wouldn’ t make money— but it does. First, many won’ t
qualify—even with realistic conditions. Second, those who do qualify often
stay as customer s. But they can only stay customers if they have something
else to buy . So have an upsell ready to apply their winnings (Section III).
Only Offer  “Win Your Money Back” If You Feel Ok With Giving
Money Back! Refunds are a part of doing business. However , when
advertised well, the Win Your Money Back offer gets tons of extra
customers. And when you give satisfied customers a great follow-up offer,
you make plenty  of profit. This more than outweighs the refunds. From the
data we’ve collected from thous ands of gyms, about 10% of all customers
will ask for their money back. If you can’ t stomach it, don’ t do this.

Offer  Store Credit Instead of Cash. If you don’t want to offer cash back,
you can offer store credit instea d. My testing showed offering store credit
and cash back got the same number of customers. So you might as well
offer store credit. But, if you still want to advertise it as ‘free,’  pair it with
an unconditional satisfaction guarantee . Adding  the unconditional guara ntee
never materially affected the number of people who wanted their money
back. Check with legal counsel in your area.
Don’t Take Blood Money . If someone doesn’ t want me to have their
money , I want it less than they do. As a personal rule, if a customer asks for
a refund—entitled or not— I give it to them.  Just focus on getting the next
customer .
How To Create Your Win Your Money Back Criteria. These criteria
make or break this of fer. Good criteria have three characteristics:
1) Easy To Track. Train them on exactly what they need to do (or they
will mess up). Bonus points if people already do it. Ex: Phones already
track steps. Word processors already track word count. Cameras
automatically date photos.
2) Gets  Customers Results. Make criteria likely to get them their
desired results. Realistic  criteria do just fine. If you think  the criteria look
too easy, you’ve  probably gotten close  to realistic. They may take a few
tries to get right, but so does anything else worth making. Ex: attend
meetings, worko uts, watch videos, etc. Whatever stuff the best customers
do to get the best results, make everyone  do it (and they’ll get great
results too).
3) Adve rtises The Business. Make advertising the business part of your
criteria. For example: posting about their participation, tagging  in social
media, referring, or leaving reviews and testimonials.
How You Apply Store Credit [IMPOR TANT]. When customers win
their money back, offer to apply it over a longer period or to a bulk
package. Just offer to apply it to something that costs more than their
winnings. In my experience, this keeps customers engaged and makes you
more money . Here’ s what that looks like:
You have a product or service that costs $200 dollars per month.
A customer wins $600 of credit. Avoid giving them three free
months up front.

Instead apply the $600 over 12 months → ($600/12 months =
$50/mo discount).
They now pay: $200 per month—$50 discount = $150 per month
To be clear, they can use credit however they want. But, I
recommend you present this first. If they ask to use it up front, you
can share my experience—people fall off if they don’t pay
something. A discount over the long haul keeps them engaged over
the long haul. So it’s in the customer’s best interest to keep some
skin in the game.
In-depth details on this Upsell Offer are in the Rollover Upsell
chapter (Section III).
All Meetings And Calls Provide Opportunities To Make More Offers.
Make check-in meetings part of your money-back criteria whenever you
can. And make all meetings required to win their money back. Beyond
helping them succeed, they are the best opportunities to make upsell offers.
So after you’ve checked in, offer what makes sense based on their feedback.
The Win Your Money Back Of fer and my gyms had three appointments:
Nutrition Orientation → “Before pictures” → I make a supplement
offer.
Progress Check-in → I make a membership offer.
Transformation Feedback → “After pictures” → I make the
membership offer again.
If they bought the membership at the last meeting, I
offered a discount if they prepaid for a year.
Make Everyone  A Winner . Promote and sell the program as though they
will only get it back if they meet the criteria. But, about halfway through,
make your next offer as if they already won. You lower the customer ’s
anxiety about failing and you’ll keep them longer . They’ll also love you
that much more. Something like:
I know you’r e trying to hit this short-term goal, but what’ s your long-term
goal?...okay that’s great to hear. You get that it’s not about this program but
about your long-term results. Tell ya what, to show you how much I want
you to hit that long-term goal, I’ll credit this program towar d the next one
whether you hit the short-term goal or not—how’ s that sound?”

At The End Of The Program, Let The “Losers” Win. If someone
refuses your first upsell and fails the challenge, you can still upsell them
again. Here’ s how: act like they won . I say something like:
“Don’ t worry about it. You started. That’ s the biggest victory of all. And
even though you didn’ t hit your short-term goal, you met ours—which was
finishing what you started. To show you that we’re in this for the long haul,
we’ll credit your entire deposit towar ds staying with us long term. That way
you get your money back and we can still hit your goal. How does that
sound?”
You’ll turn that frown upside down and they’ll love you for it. Remember
—we don’ t get customers to make a sale, we make sales to get customers .
