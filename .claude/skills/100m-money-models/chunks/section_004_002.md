Many will enter…many will win.
Disclaimer : Sweepstakes and giveaways are heavily regulated.
Main reason: they’re except ionally powerful. And, when done
wrong, can become illegal lotteries—we don’t want that. Jail
time—no bueno. Make sure you follow all the local advertising
laws. This description is in no way a guarantee of lawfulness. I
take no respon sibility for anything you do or don’t do as a result
of reading this chapter . Whew—ok—got that outta the way .
August 2020.
I hopped on the phone with the owner of a fitness certification business to
talk shop . In a few minutes, he gave me the rundown about how they certify
fitness enthusiasts and help them find clients.
“Interesting business you’ve got,” I said. “How do you get leads?”
“It’s pretty simple. We advert ise a full-ride scholarship to our entire
program. People apply with their contact information and then answer a few
questions. We ask stuff like ‘Why should we pick you for the full-ride
scholarship?’  The best answer gets a full-ride. But we also do something
more…”
“Nice, keep going…” I said.

“We give out partial scholarships.”
“What do you mean? How does that work?”
“Well, we often have a clear winner for the full-ride. But tons of people
have inspiring stories, so I want to make sure they got scholarships too.
Now I can only give away one full-ride, but I can give away as many
partial scholarships as I want. ”
And then it hit me.
“Ooohhh… So lots of people apply for the ‘grand prize’  and only one
person gets that. But the other applicants qualify for smaller prizes?”
“Right. So I make a big deal out of the person who wins the full-ride
scholarship, but then I call everyone else to let them know they got a partial
scholarship. When I talk to them, they’re thrilled. Most of them join our
program on the spot.”
“So they don’t know the actual price of your thing when they hop on the
call?”
“Nope.”
“But they know the value  of the full-ride  scholarship, and when you
present the discounted price of your program with the partial scholarship,
it’s still huge savings.”
“Exactly .”
“So not only do you get tons of engaged leads, but you also get more
customers with your ‘surprise discount?’  Genius.”
“It work s really well. We actually have to cap it to make sure we can
service all the new sign-ups. Believe it or not, we teach the same  play to the
trainers we certify . It works just as well to get fitness customers—
sometimes even better .”
“Love it.”

He presented this as an education offer and as a fitness offer. But it’s so
much more. I’m gonna show you how to use it in any business. Free
Giveaways generate many leads who show interest in your most expensive
product.  What could be better?

Description
Giveaway Offers advertise a chance to win a big prize in exchange for
contact informa tion and whatever else you want. Then, after picking a
winner , you offer everyone else the big prize at a discounted price.
Giveaways also go by names like “scholarship” and “sweepstakes” and
“raffles” etc. They all mean “enter for a chance to win.” To run a Giveaway
Offer you:
Pick a Grand Prize.
Pick your promotional offer.
Ask for contact information and other eligibility criteria.
Pick what actions you want entrants to take to qualify for the big
prize.
Put the giveaway on a deadline to add urgency.
Announce the Grand Prize winner and contact everyone else.
Let’s go into each with more detail.
Pick A Grand Prize.  Make your Gran d Prize the thing you want everyone
to buy. Make sure you assign a monetary value to your grand prize to serve
as a price anchor . For instance, if you sell $5,000 worth of value for $2,000,
then advertise the $5,000 value!
Pick Your Promotional Offer . Your promotional offer takes the place of
the “partial scholarship” in the story . You create it by enhancing your core
offer with a discount, a bonus, or by minorly changing it from  the Grand
Prize in order to ethically justify a price reduction (using the Grand Prize as
a price anchor). And the bigger the discount, the more compelling the offer.
So the bigger the value you assign your Grand Prize, the better!
Remember , leads entered the Giveaway because they found the Grand
Prize interesting . It gets you qualified leads because you offer what they
already showed interest in at a discount. Call your promotional offer—the
thing you sell to everyone else—whatever you want for your giveaway:
scholarship, gift card, dollars of f, store credit, vouchers, etc.
Ask For Contact Information.  In exchange for a chance to win, ask for
permission to contact them any way you please for follow-up promotions.

Beyond that, I survey for prize eligibility and then ask them to take
qualifying  actions .
Eligibility . I ask if they’re a fit for my products. Like ‘Do you own a vet
clinic?’  or more character/need-based questions like ‘Why should you be
selected?’
Qualifying Actions. Other stuff entrants do to qualify to win. I also use
these to get them to promote my giveaway more, or demons trate higher
levels of interest. Ex: attending  a call or event, making a post, entering a
group, etc.
Put The Giveaway On A Dead line To Add Urgency . Set a date for the
Grand Prize drawing. Make your Giveaway more urgent by only making it
available for a limited time. I like three to seven days from the day I start
promoting it. As soon as leads enter the Giveaway—update them daily .
First, let them know how long they have left until you announce  the winner .
You can do this with email, direct messages, texts, social media posts, and
so on. Do as many as reasonable. Once a day across all platforms works
fine. Second, provide value along with your countdown. Show everyone the
benefits of the grand prize, how excited they should be, and refer everyone
to social pr oof. Keep the hype alive!
Pro Tip: Whisper–T ease–Shout
Once people enter the Free Giveaway , it may help to think of
the countdown like a mini-product launch. So check out the
Affiliates and Partners chapter of $100M Leads  for a detailed
look on launches.
Announce The Grand Prize Winner  And Start Contacting Everyone
Else.  Announce the Grand Prize winner publicly , then message everyone
else who qualifies for your core offer privately . The beauty is—everybody
else qualifies for your promotional offer . Notify  them by text, email, and
direct messages. In that message, ask them to schedule a call because they
qualified for something else. If you need a reason—just say you found their
answers/story so compelling you felt obligated to give them something just
for entering. Think of your promotional of fer like a “participation trophy .”

To make sure they redeem, add another deadline. Make claiming your
promotional offer (the scholarship, gift card, dollars off, store credit,
vouchers, etc.) expire in seven days. The second countdown works like the
first: show the benefits, more social proof, and more valuable  stuff about
your of fer. Give them a way to book a call to claim the promotional of fer.
Explain The Cost-T o-Value Using Their Discount.  My rule of thumb:
make your core offer discount equal to 10%–30% of your gross margins.
Say we advertis e a Grand Prize  with a $5,000 value with a $2,000 retail
price tag. Everyone else gets it for $1,800 (a 10% discount off retail). When
we let them know they qualified for something , we explain they get $5,000
in value for an $1,800 price tag. By comparing the value of the thing to
what they pay , a 10% discount becomes a 64% dif ference in cost-to-value!
Bottom Line: Remember , everyone that entered the Giveaway showed
interest in your thing. And if somebody shows interest in a thing you have
to offer— offer it to them.

Important Notes:
Consult Legal Counsel About How To Structur e Your Giveaway . I’m
not legal counsel, but I do consider these no-brainers because of the way I
like to do business: somebody actually has to win the Grand Prize. Make
the Grand Prize, and qualifications to win, clear in the rules. Make clear
that more than one person can win a prize. Ask your legal counsel about the
rest.
Eligibility Criteria Get More Customers To Buy Your Core Offer .
More people will take your core offer if you can make the value specific to
them. I ask questions like this to get ammo:  Why should we pick you? Why
this program? Why now? Why does this matter to you? Why is this
important to you? What’ s your goal? Etc.
That being said, the more work you make it to enter the fewer people will
enter , but the more qualified they’ll be— so find your sweet spot .
If Your Giveaw ay Doesn’t Work, It Means Your Grand Prize Wasn’t
Grand Enough.
One of my portf olio companies  ran a giveaway . They barely got interest.
Their grand prize? Tickets to their event. Not compelling. I told them grand
prizes only work if they’re grand. They tried it again with a $50,000 bundle
of equipment from a well-know n industry supplier plus their core product
for a year . And, this time, it crushed (surprise).
When you have an awesome thing to give away and you advertise it
properly , the leads flood in. And “Giveaway” kinda explains itself. So if
nobody bites, then I suggest you give away something better . Or at least,
better for the audience .
Give Away Two Prizes For Twice The Leads.  If you give away one
prize, that’s fine. But if you give away two grand prizes, you can get twice
the leads (or more). Here’ s how. Just tell everyone that if someone they
refer wins the grand prize, they win one too. That way, they get endless
‘entries’  into the contest by referring their friends. This gets more people to
refer (and work together). This also provides a sneaky benefit. Referrers are
invested in the success of their referrals. This keeps quality high. Here’ s an
example I did for Skool.com, a platform I co-own for people to build and
monetize communities.

Scar city, Scar city, Scar city. Limit your giveaway by time, number of
entries, or both. You can run giveaways for a specific amount of time (ex:
seven days), a specific number of entries (ex: 5,000 entries), or both. I like
both. I match how many people I let enter the giveaway with the number of
people I have the time and resources to connect with inside seven days. Any
more would be a waste.
Urgency , Urgen cy, Urgency . I add urgency in three places—to enter , to
claim, to use. Make how long they have to enter  clear in the advertisements.
Once you announce the winner(s), let them know how long they have to
claim . When they do, schedule their call the same day or the next day (if
you can). Once you let people know what they won, tell them  how long
they have to use it. I like hours,  but I have gone up to five days. In short,
always have deadlines.
Have Downsells Available. Some won’ t or can’t buy your promotional
offer, even with the discount or bonus. And that’s okay . Here’ s how I
approach it: at the start of the call, let them know they qualif ied for two
prizes. And that you’ll help them  find which way makes the most sense for

them. Then, present your promo tional offer first—aka, the discount on the
Grand Prize thing. If they take it, great. If not, then offer the same discount
by percentage  on any other product you have that makes sense for them.
If You Have A Recurring Revenue Business.  Apply their discount over
the longest period of time they’ll agree to. Then, set up their monthly
subscription to bill automatically  at normal rates after the discounted period
ends.
Summary Points
At their core, Giveaways ask an audience to apply to get a high-
value thing of yours for free. Many will enter—one wins. The rest
qualify for discounts on your core offer.
Pick a Grand Prize people want.
Give two prizes away if you want more people to refer. Tell them if
someone they refer wins, they win the other prize.
Offer a chance to win the Grand Prize to anyone who enters and
qualifies.
You can get great information from every lead because you can
make it part of the entry process. Get information that indicates
how your offer will provide them value. This becomes important
for making offers later.
Advertise your Giveaway for seven days, or until the number of
leads surpasses the number of people you can manage to call in
seven days, whichever comes first.
Book appointments with everyone else to claim your promotional
offer. Use whatever “reason why” feels good to you.
Putting an expiration date on people claiming their prize makes
them more likely to claim it.
If somebody says no to your core offer, have another product or
service to discount. It may suit the lead better.
