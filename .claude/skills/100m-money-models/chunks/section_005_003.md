The only thing worse than making a $1,000 offer to a person with a $100
budget…
is making a $100 offer to someone with a $1,000 budget.
2016. After Starting Gym Launch, But Befor e Making Money .
I had spent my last five years showerless, in sweats and a tank top. But
now I had Gym Launch, and a fashionable friend said I should look
professional. “Businessmen don’t wear tank tops Alex. I know the owner of
a local suit shop. I’ll tell him you’re coming.” I took his advice and went.
So, I budgeted $500 for a suit— a big purchase at the time. I walked into
the suit shop and made small talk. The owner knew I was coming. Wow. I
told him I just started a new business and wanted a “boss suit.” He took my
measurements, then grabbed two suits of f the rack. I put the first one on.
“How’ s it look? How do you feel?”
I smiled. I felt cool. Like a rich guy. It was nice. He talked about some
accessories but I didn’ t listen much. I was ‘too cool’  to listen now (ha!).
This is gonna be awesome . He turned to talk to an employ ee. I flipped the
price tag over so I could see it…

…$16,000. My face turned red. All I could think was my friend asked the
owner to make time for me and I can’t even affor d anything here. I felt
horrified. I kept my head down to try and hide my shock. I took a breath
and looked up. I failed. He had seen me blush.
Coming to my aid he asked “Do you care about the designer much?”
“Not at all.”
Almost before I finished replying, the owner whirled around and draped
the next suit over my shoulders. “T ry this on for size.” he said.
I looked in the mirror . Looks good.
Then I looked down at the price tag… $2,200.
It wasn’ t $500. But it wasn’ t $16,000  either . Sigh of r elief.
“Yea. This works. I’ll take this one.”
He winked and nodded. “Y ou got it boss.”
The owner sold me some socks, a handkerchief, and a shirt to go with it.
All in, another $300. But, after seeing the $16,000 price tag on the first suit,
everything  seemed cheap.

Looking back, this wasn’ t the owner ’s first rodeo. He was a real pro. I
spent five times more than I had budgeted and felt OK about it. I only later
realized he used a Price Anchor .
Description
With Anchor Upsells, you offer premium stuff first. If the customer gasps,
you of fer a cheaper but acceptable alternative.
Basically , if you present your main offer, some  people will buy it. Duh.
But, if you present a premium version that’s 5x–10x the price first, lots of
people will say no. Then, when you present your main offer, it looks like a
much  better deal. So, more people will buy it. Aha! That’ s the power of
Anchor Upsells.
Anchor Upsells work best when the lower -price offer has the same core
functions  as the premium one. For instan ce, I didn’ t care about the designer
that much. I just needed a suit. So, compared to the $16,000 suit, the $2,200
suit was a way better deal .

Anchor Upsells also have two amazing bonuses. First, anchored
customers spend  more than they normally would.  Second, some customers
still buy the super expensive thing.
Here are the steps:
1. Present the Anchor—the really expensive thing.
2. Get “The Gasp”—expect the customer to freak out about the cost.
3. Come to the rescue—ask if they care about what makes it
premium.
4. Present your main offer—expect the customer to feel relieved and
see the better deal.
5. Ask how they wanna pay—Which card do you prefer?
Pro Tip: The Only Thing Worse Than Making A $1,000 Offer  To
A Person With A $100 Budget…is Making A $100 Offer  To
Someone With A $1,000 Budget.
In the first situation you lose $100. In the second, you lose
$900.  I’ve lost tons of customers and mountains of cash because
customers wanted more than I had to offer. Boo. So now I
always have premium upsells ready . Only a handful of
customers buy them, but that handful of customers bring big
profits. So always have premium offers even if most people don’t
buy. Remember , you won’t lose customers by offering premium
stuff first , but you WILL  lose money if you don’ t.
Examples
Local Service: Lawn Care
Premium Anchor:  Get my cell phone number , fancy mulch, natural pest
control, bi-weekly yard maintenance—$1,000 per week
Main Offer:  Get my team’ s number , generic mulch, normal pest control,
bi-weekly yard maintenance—$200 per week

Physical Product: A Painting
Premium Ancho r: Super protective packaging + 20 year insurance + gift
wrapped = $1,000
Main Offer:  Normal packaging + 1 year insurance + sticker = $200
Digital Product: Newsletter
Premium Anchor: All previous issues + new issues + 24hrs early =
$199/mo
Main Offer: New issues only + on time = $19/mo
Important Notes
If You Treat The Anchor  Like A Fake, So Will The Custom er. Some
people hear about this technique. Try it. Gloss over the premium offer. And
then say it doesn’ t work . But if you do that, then the person never really
considered it because you never really offered it. You went through the
motions . For this to work, you need to actually sell it and they have to
actually conside r it. Only after they pause, hesitate, or ask for something
else, do you move to the next thing.
Make A Premium Offer  You Actually Want People To Buy. A friend of
mine struggled to get this worki ng. I only had to listen to one call to figure
out the problem . He made up some BS that he didn’ t really want them to
buy. So we tweaked the offer to something he would actually  feel happy to
deliver if someone paid… and they did. Tripling his profits.  Actually present
your premium offer like you want  people to take it. And when you do, some
will. And if they don’ t, you still anchored them.
A Proper Anchor  Gets “The Gasp.” When you do an anchor upsell
correctly , customers will have mini panic attacks. I call this “The Gasp.”
Gasps used to really stress me out. But then I realized somethin g huge. The
bigger the gasp, the more they bought.
Once You Get The Gasp—Co me To The Rescue. In the story , I gave
“The Gasp.” Then, the sales pro saved my ego by asking if I cared about the
designer . When I said no, he presented the next suit. Key point : he already
had the 1/8th price suit pulled before my reaction. He knew  I woul d
probably gasp. And if your customers don’t gasp, then they probably find
your premium offer reasonable… so just ask them if they wanna use the card

on file (ha! Go for it!). Just don’t do a gasp of your own when they say yes.
You’re welcome. You can buy me a beer later .
To Get More People To Buy Your Main Offer , Make It A Better Deal.
Only tweak a few features from your premium offer to make your main
offer. Every offer has features. Some features matter more than others. You
want the primary features to stay the same. Fewer people care about
secondary featur es, so change those . This allows customers to get the same
primary features and a way better deal.  Most people just want a suit. A few
people want a fancy suit. A suit is the primary feature. The material,
designer , etc. is secondary . After anchoring, offering the primary features
for a fifth of the price makes the main of fer a great deal.
Summary
If you present a more expensive offer before a less expensive offer,
more people will buy the less expensive offer than they would have
if you had presented the less expensive offer on its own.
Present anchor. Get gasp. Come to the rescue. Present core offer.
Ask for payment.
For the most effective anchor, make your premium offer 5–10x
more expensive.
Anchored customers spend a bit more than they plan to.
Don’t treat the anchor like a fake, or the customer will too. You
lose trust and waste time.
Important: Some customers will buy the premium offer.
Expensive premium offers add outsized profits with fewer sales.
The main offer and the premium offer should have the same
primary features.
The premium offer has different secondary—aka ‘premium’—
features.
After anchoring, offering the primary features for a fifth of the
price makes the main offer a great deal. It gives them ‘basically the
same thing’ for way less.
