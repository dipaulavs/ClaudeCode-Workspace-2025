Buy one puppy , get two puppies fr ee!
Downtown Nashville 2020.
Bars and shops at this popular tourist destination went in and out of
business all the time, but one store reigned supreme: Boot Factory . Their
neon sign cut through the visual  clutter on the street like a hot knife through
butter . A cowbo y boot bigger than my car—directing me to the front door.
There was no mistaking what they wanted me to do. So of course, I obeyed.
And as I got closer , I could make out their of fer:
BUY  1 PAIR GET TWO P AIR FREE


A decade passed since I’d been to Nashville. But, I remembered the sign
and the buy-one-get-two-free offer like it was yesterday . As a kid on bar
crawls, I thought the offer was dumb. “How could they give away so much
stuff and stay in business?” But now, with some offer-makin g under my
belt, I could appreciate it.
I went straight to the men’ s section and grabbed a boot. Curious , the price
was marked down twice —to a “final offer” of $600 for the pair. But these
were normal-looking boots? The young me would’ve scoffed. But business
me realized I had missed something. The store got much bigger since the
last time I saw it, so the of fer clearly worked. Then it clicked.
They charged three times the price for a single pair of boots because they
came with two more pairs.  So rathe r than saying “come to Boot Factory  and
buy boots at a fair price” they managed to create a free offer! Even in the
few minutes I checked out the store, bachelorettes filed in to get matching
boots. And since the Boot Factory  sat in the middle of a street full of
cowboy-themed bars, this happened a lot. It was brilliant .
Description
In Buy X Get Y Free Offers, when customers buy something , they get
other stuff free. The more free stuff they get, and the higher its value, the
better it works. Free offers get way more attention than Discount Offers.
But if you only have one thing to sell, and you give it away , you go hungry .
In situations like this, businesses  tend to lean on discounts. They run “sales”
relying on holidays, seasona l changes, or whatever , as reasons to
temporarily  lower prices and get more customers.
But, by selling more than one thing at once, you can turn Discount Offers
into even  stronger Free Offers. When you have  more than one item, you can
make the discount value large enough that it covers the price of more stuff.
For example, I could sell three t-shirts for $10 each for a total of $30 or I
could sell one t-shirt for $30 and give two away free. It’s the same price, but
way mor e free stuff!

And if I wanted to offer a disco unt (rather than only reframe  the price) I
could do this. I could sell three t-shirts for $6.67 each for a total of $20
(33% discount) or keeping  the same discount, I could sell one t-shirt for
$20 and give two away free. It’s the same price, but way more free stuff
again!
Boot Factory took the first option. They tripled the price of one pair of
boots and added  value…in more boots. And an expensive pair of boots with
two free pairs gets Boot Factory  more customers than selling one pair at a
fair price. Plus, if you can include free then it attracts even more customers.
Examples
Buy 1 Get 2 Fr ee Physical Pr oducts Offer: (The Boot Factory  Offer)
One Pair of Boots: $200
Buy X Get Y Free Offer: Buy One Pair For $600, Get Two Pairs
for Free
End Result: They still buy three pairs of $200 boots for a total of
$600

3 Versions: 18 Months Of Services AKA  “3 Pairs Of Boots”
Good: “Buy 12 Months Get 6 Months Free” - $1,800
Better: “Buy 9 Months Get 9 Months Free” - $1,800
Best: “Buy 6 Months Get 12 Months Free” - $1,800
Everyone pays the same price for the same amount of service. But, the
third option is the most compelling.  (Hint: It has the most free stuf f!)
Important Notes
Buy X Get Y Free Gets People To Buy More Stuff And Provides More
Value. It used to take a whole year for some of my service businesse s to
make their money . But the “Buy 6 Months Get 6 Months Free” offer
attracted far more customers than the origin al month-to-month offer. Even
better , they got paid up front for it!
Raise Prices Befor e Giving Stuff Away To Preserve Profits.  If you use
this to attract customers, it will work. And since it will work, you need to
make money . So, permanently  raise prices to accommodate the discount.
Don’ t lie. Actually raise your prices. Since this is what all new customers
will be coming in on, then it makes sense to change it, for a season at least.
Plus, plenty of people might still take your doubled prices a la carte and
break your limiting beliefs around pricing. You’re welcome.
Buy X Get Y Free Works Better  If You Have More Free Stuff Than
Paid Stuff.
See second exam ple. Buy ten get two free is not as strong as buy two get
ten free. This seems obvious, but again, people don’t do it. To make it work
better , give more free than you ask people to buy. Just play with the pricing
until it makes sense for you. ‘Buy one get two’  instead of ‘buy two get one’.
The Fr ee Things Can Be Differ ent Fr om The Paid Things.

When people first start doing offers like this, they match the free and paid
stuff. But you can mix and match whatever you want. Just make sure the
value of the differ ent free stuff still makes the offer compelling. Ex: Let’s
say socks have a $10 value. If they buy one shirt for $10 but get $20 of free
socks, it may seem like a better deal.
More Free Cheaper  Things Can Work Better  Than Fewer  Free
Expensive Things.
Revisiting the t-shirt example. Let’s say I could only afford to give one
shirt away for free, but for the same cost I could give them three pairs of
socks. I’d proba bly test “Buy 1 Shirt Get 1 Shirt Free” against “Buy 1 Shirt,
Get 3 Socks Free.” Socks cost less than a shirt but people still see “buy one
thing get three  things free.” Sometimes , more cheaper  things work better
than fewer  expensive things.
Rather  Than Offer  a 33% Discount, Try Buy One Get Two Fr ee.

Even though it can be structured to accomplish the same thing, free drives
more interest than a discount. More people know the value of free than the
value of one shirt. For example , rather than sell $10 shirts for $6.67 each
(33% off), you may get more interest (and make more money) by offering
“buy one shirt for $20 get two free.” Test it.
Do Not Make Offers Like This If You Can’t Manage Money . While
Buy X Get Y Free offers create massive cash flow for a busines s, you need
to deliver . So if you get a whole  year’s worth of payments in a month, make
sure you can deliver  for the whole year. Budget the correct amount of
money to service your customer s for the duration of your agreement. Don’ t
be a goon and buy yourself a house with the cash meant for servicing your
customers. Selling stuff you can’t deliver on breaks the law and ruins  your
reputation. Deliver on your promises.
Make This Offe r To Existing Customers For Fast Cash.  If you have a
recurring business already , and need cash fast, you can make this offer to
existing custome rs. Many will happily ‘Buy Ten and Get Two Free’  even at
their current price. Just limit the offer to 10% of your customers. This gives
you a good cash pop and keeps recurring cash flow healthy .
Don’t Worry. Prepaid Custom ers Keep Buying Stuff. So, Keep Selling
It To Them. A lot of people don’t want to make more offers to customers
who prepay for stuff. This is a mistake. Speaking from experien ce, these are
people who spend the most money. Give them other offers to buy, and they
will. After all, they may have prepaid months ago. Their wallets have been
‘refreshed’  with new money that is dying to make it into your pocket. Don’ t
get in the way!
If Custo mers Only Buy Once, Make Them Buy Big. The Boot Factory
in my story catered to tourists that want to fit in the local cowboy bars. This

means most of their customers made one purchase. Ever. For that reason, it
makes sense to make that purchase as large as possible. Just provide the
value to back it up. If you only have one shot, you may as well make it
count!
Summary Points

get other stuff free.
Buy X Get Y Free works for stuff that makes sense to buy more of
or get longer access to.
Basic Buy X Get Y Free offers reframe pricing. Buy 1 Get 2 Free
costs the same as buying 3…except customers see the free offer as
more valuable. (18 Months of Service example)

more things costs less per thing than buying the same number of
things one at a time.

will keep them for four months (or whatever you set it at). This
gives you more opportunities to make more offers and provide
more value.
If you use Buy X Get Y Free to generate a lot of cash fast, make
sure you manage it well and deliver on your promises.

customers. Just cap how many you sell so you still have cash flow.
