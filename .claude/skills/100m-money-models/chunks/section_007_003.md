# Waived Fee Offer

**Path:** Section V: Continuity Offers/Waived Fee Offer
**Type:** section

---

You can sign up month-to-month with a setup fee, or I’ll waive it if you
commit to a year .
January 2021.
For years, I heard stories about this legend of high-ticket sales. Today , I
finally got to meet him. But then, it got weird. You’d think a man with a
reputation like his would also love working, but not him. In fact, his views
about work nearly opposed  mine—he aimed to work as little as possible .
And those “lifestyle” guys tend to put me off. But he had his legendary
reputation for a reason. So, it made me all the more interested…
“I’d rather make a few million bucks a year with zero employee s and cool
customers than build some gigantic business that panders to anyone willing
to give me a buck,” he said. “I don’t need to feed my ego, I just collect
monthly payments and chill.”
Yeah right. “Monthly paym ents? That sounds less chill than up front.
Don’ t you have  to deal with churn, back outs, and all the other hassles of
continuity?” I said.
“Nope. Not really . The way I sell is so simple you’ll kick yourself once
you hear it,” he said.
“I’m all ears.”
“I tell customers  they have two options: ‘You can go month-to-month with
a big setup fee. It covers the cost of getting you started, but you can leave
whenever . Or, if you commit to a year, I’ll waive the fee.’ And I make the fee
huge, so buyers commit to avoid it. I also have them initial that they
understand they can quit early if they pay the fee I waived.”

“Why such a big fee?” I asked.
“It costs a lot to quit in the beginning, so that keeps them engaged and—”
I chimed in “and once they pass that point, it costs about the same to
cancel as it does to stick it out. So, they just stick it out.”
“Bingo.”
Description
Waived Fee Offers work like this. First, you ask the custome r to pay a
startup fee as part of joining a month-to-month program. Typically , I do 3–
5x my monthly  rate. Then, you offer to discount the entire fee if they
commit longer term. But, if they cancel inside the term, they pay the fee.
Customers can choose to pay a significant fee and keep the option to quit
at any time, or they can commit to 12 months and get the fee waived. Many
will commit to avoid the big fee.
We take a greater risk if they pay month-to-month. But they take a greater
risk if they commit. If a customer chooses month-to-month, we lower our
risk with the startup fee. But, we lower their  risk year-to-year by waiving
those fees. And if they commit and want to quit early , then OK. They pay as
if they had chosen “month-to-month” from the beginning. Simple.
Bottom Line:  Customers will stay longer if leaving costs more than
staying.
Example
Since the offer focuses more on pricing, it looks the same in all continuity
businesses. The following example pulls from the story to give you a closer
look at the mechanics.
Waived Fees With Commitment.
1. Commitment length - 12 months
2. Monthly rate - $1,000 per month
3. Fee - $5,000 if they pay month-to-month.
Option A: Pay a one-time fee of $5,000 plus $1,000 for the first month.
Then pay $1,000 per month thereafter . Cancel whenever you want.

Option B: Waive the $5,000 if you commit to 12 months. Pay $1,000 per
month. Only pay the $5,000 fee if you break your commitment early .
Important Notes
Fees Get Them To Start.  People  get value out of committing
immediately  because they avoid a fee. People want to avoid fees. So, more
people sign up to continuity . Mission accomplished.
Fees Get Them To Stick. People will stick for the same reason they
started.  By sticking, they avoid the fee. People quit for millions of reasons.
But, by incurring an additional and larger fee in order to cancel, their
original reason for quitting immediately shrinks compared to the value of
avoiding the fee. In English, if the cost to quit exceeds the cost to stay, they
will probably stay .
Presenting The Fee. Justify the fee by explaining the costs of taking on
new customers for long-term programs. Basically , if they want short-term
flexibility , they pay their own setup costs . But, if they commit to staying
long-term, we pay their setup costs for them . If someone asks for additional
reasoning, just say: “It costs us money to get you started. If you only wanna
test us out, you cover those costs. If you commit longer , I’ll cover them.”
If More Than 5% Of People Want To Cancel Early , Look Into It.
Pricing incentivizes  sticking  but it can’t (and shouldn’ t) overco me a terrible
product. You want to nudge them, not handcuf f people into paying for
something they hate. Then, they’ll just hate you.
If You Want More Up Front Cash, Have A Smaller  Fee. A smaller fee
encourages people to go month-to-month. A larger fee encourages people to
make the commitment. But if you need more cash up front, you can make
the fee 1.5–3x the monthly rate. When you do this, more people will take it,
and you’ll get more cash up front.
Drop The Fee After  The Customer  Fulfills The Commitment. If
someone stays the entirety of their commitment, then wants to cancel, they
have earned their free cancellat ion. It doesn’ t stick forever . This makes it
equitable.
I Prefer This Offer  For Comm itments Of One Year And Longer. The
longer the comm itment, the better this works. It works especially well with

services that take a long time to work (SEO, Investing, Weight Loss, etc.). It
keeps people committed when  they get emotional.
Cancellation Fees For A…Cau se? If you want to keep customers extra
motivated, you can donate it to a cause they are against . Ex: “What cause
do you absolutely hate?... Great. If you cancel early , I will be donating your
setup fee to them. ” This gives them two reasons to stay. First, because they
don’t want to shell out the cash. Second, because they don’t want a cause
they hate to get it.
Summary Points
Waived Fee Offers present a month-to-month option with a fee or
waive the fee if they commit.
I typically make the fee 3–5x my monthly rate.
At minimum, the commitment length should be a year.
The larger your fee, the more buyers will opt for the commitment.
The smaller your fee, the more up front cash you’ll get.
If the customer meets the commitment, the fee officially goes
away.
