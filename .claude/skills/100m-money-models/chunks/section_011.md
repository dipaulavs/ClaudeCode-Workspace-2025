Nom nom nom.
Kinda like the previews after the credits finish, if you’re still with me, I
wanted to give you a bunch of goodies.
1. If you’re struggling to figure out who to sell to, I released a
chapter called “Your First Avatar.” You can get it for free at
Acquisition.com/avatar. Just pop in your email and we’ll send it
over.
2. If you’re struggling to figure out what to sell, you can go to
Amazon or wherever you buy books and search “Alex Hormozi”
and $100M Offers. It should get you on the right path.
3. If you’re struggling to get people interested in what you sell,
you can go to Amazon or wherever you buy books and search
“Alex Hormozi” and $100M Leads. It should get you on the right
path.

4. If your company is over $1M in EBITDA (profit), we’d love to
help you scale. It brings so much pleasure to know companies
have grown much bigger and faster than mine because they
avoided the mistakes I made. If you want us to take a look under
the hood and see if we can help go to Acquisition.com.
5. If you want a job at Acquisition.com or in one of our
companies—we love hiring from #mozination. Our best returns
come from investing in great people. Go to
Acquisition.com/careers/open-jobs, and you can see all the
available openings.
6. To get the free book downloads and video trainings that come
with this book, go to Acquisition.com/training/money.
7. If you like listening to podcasts and want to hear more, my
podcast at the time of this writing is top 5 in entrepreneurship and
top 15 in business in the US. You can get there by searching
“Alex Hormozi” wherever you listen. Or, by going to
Acquisition.com/podcast. I share useful and interesting stories,
valuable lessons, and the essential mental models I rely on every
day.
8. If you like to watch videos, we put a lot of resources into our
free training, available for everyone. We intend on making it
better than any paid stuff out there, and let you decide if we
succeeded. You can find our videos on YouTube or wherever you
watch videos by searching “Alex Hormozi.”
9. And if you like short-form videos, check out the bite-sized
content we pump out daily at Acquisition.com/media. You’ll see
all the places we post and you can pick the ones you like the
most.
And last, thank you again. Please be one of those givers and share this
with other entrepreneurs by leaving a review . It woul d mean the world to
me. I’m sending  you business-building vibes from my desk. I spend a lot of
time there, so it’s a lot of vibes. May your desire be greater than your
obstacles.
