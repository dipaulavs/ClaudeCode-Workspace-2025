HYPOTHETICAL  PERFORMANCE RESUL TS HAVE MANY  INHERENT  LIMIT ATIONS,
SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED  BELOW . NO REPRESENT ATION IS BEING MADE
THAT ANY BUSINE SS WILL  OR IS LIKEL Y TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR
TO THOSE SHOWN OR DESCRIBE D. IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUE NTLY SHARP
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTH ETICAL  PERFORMANCE RESUL TS AND THE
ACTUAL  RESUL TS SUBSEQUENTL Y ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR  BUSINESS.
ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL  PERFORMANCE RESU LTS IS THAT
THEY  ARE GENERALL Y PREP ARED WITH THE BENEFIT  OF HINDSIGHT . IN ADDITION,
HYPOTHETICAL  BUSINESS DOES NOT  INVOL VE FINANCIAL  RISK, AND NO
HYPOTHETICAL  BUSINESS RECORD CAN COMPLETEL Y ACCOUNT  FOR THE IMPACT
OF FINANCIAL  AND OTHER RISK IN ACTUAL  BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY
TO WITHST AND LOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR BUSINESS STRA TEGY
IN SPITE OF BUSINESS LOSSES ARE MATERIAL  POINTS WHICH  CAN ALSO
ADVERSEL Y AFFECT  ACTUAL  BUSINESS RESUL TS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER
FACTORS RELA TED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL  OR TO THE IMPLEMENT ATION
OF ANY SPECIFIC  BUSINESS PROGRAM, WHICH CANNOT  BE FULL Y ACCOUNTED
FOR IN THE PREP ARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL  PERFORMANCE. When used herein,
this “book” means this book, its contents, and all information and ideas contained therein.

A Quick Word
LEILA:
I wrote this dedication seven years ago in my first book…
I want to thank my partner , my ride-or -die, Leila. You found me at my
absolute worst, and you have fought beside me shoulder to shoulder ever
since. You said you would sleep with me under a bridge if it came to that,
and I have never forgotten. You stood tall when everything was crumbling
around me. I would go to war with you. I would die for you. If the world
were a hurricane, standing with you is like being in the eye, calmly
observing the storm raging around us. There’s no one else I’d want by my
side to fight the battles that come. Being with you makes the stars look
within r each. Her e’s to a life filled with the impossible.
And seven years later…nothing’ s changed.
TREV OR: As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another .
Proverbs 27:17
It’s a rare and wonderful thing to have the smartest man you’ve met call you a friend . If ignorance is
the only true evil, and knowledge, the only true good, you, my brother , are a force of good. The
world is better with you in it. And I will fight to keep it that way. My life wouldn’ t be the same
without you. I would n’t be the same without you. I doubt I will ever be able to repay the favor you
have given  me by being in my life. But I’ll live trying. Thank you for giving me a gift far more than a
paragraph at the beginning of a book can ever repay . We will put our brick in the wall. Here’ s to a
once in a generation friendship. Philia.
