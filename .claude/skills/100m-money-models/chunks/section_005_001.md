If you want to make more profit per customer , you gotta sell
them more stuff. Knowing the right time, way, and stuff to sell is
key. I’ve learned my fair share of lessons doing it the wrong

The Classic Upsell
You Can’ t Have X W ithout Y!
Summer 2016.
He was a premie r fur coat dealer , a fourth-generation business savant, and
a childhood mentor of mine. We sat down to catch up in a swanky
restaurant across from his shop. Within a minute of ordering, our salmon
appeared.
“What do you think this salmon costs the restaurant? Three bucks? Maybe
a few extra pennies for the garnish? And look at the menu—they’re
charging thirty-two bucks! Unbelievable…but…we pay it.” He took his
first bite, chuckled to himself, then continued.
“So I heard you got into the game—good for you. Never would’ve
guessed when you worked at the shop. You were kinda awkward.”
“What can I say? Brushing seven thousand fur coats in a row melted my
brain.” I chuckled, “Y ou still making a killing on that?”
A sheepish grin appeared. “Yeah. And that’s not even the best part, my son
came up with something genius.” His son would be the fifth-generation
owner .
“Tell me about it.” I asked.

“We advertise free earmuf fs with coat storage. And get this. When
customers come to get their muffs and store their coats he says, ‘Great. And
we’ll store those as well for $30. You don’t want to store anyth ing else do
you?’  And of course, they say no.”
“Wait a second, so you get them to pay for additional storage for the free
ear muf fs by getting them to say no? You guys are legends.”
“Oh us? Noooo. We just stay creative…and if something works, we stick
with it.”

Whenever he talked business, he’d light up. Despite being awkward
around his shop, I learned many lifelong lessons from him. I share this story
in homage to those lessons.
Description
The Classic Upsell offers a solution to the customer ’s next problem the
moment  they become aware of it. I explain the Classic Upsell first because
it’s extremely profitable, easy, and anyone can do it. Main reason: current
customers always  have a higher chance of buying your stuff than strangers.
And, when timed right, customers upsell themselves.
The Classic Upsell relies on knowing more about your customer ’s
problem than they do. And you darn well should—it’ s your business after
all. The idea is simple—your core offer solves one problem and creates
another . Your upsell immediately solves that next problem. This gives the
classic upsell its “You can’t have X without Y” structure. Like the rental car
story . You can’t have a car without insurance. You can’t have a car without
gas. You can’t have a good trip without a late checkout. Etc. And all of
these things become immediate ly apparent as soon as the customer makes
the first purchase.
Bottom Line:  If a problem appears, and you can solve it immediately—in
exchange for money— do it!
Examples
Local Car Wash Service
First purchase: Car Wash

Upsell: Sealant
You’re not gonn a wanna do the wash without sealant. You get way more
for your money .
Physical Product
First Purchase: Bicycle
Upsell #1: Helmet
Upsell #2: Lights
Upsell #3: Puncture-Resistant Tires
You can’ t have a bike without a helmet!
Digital Product
First purchase: Course on exercising
Upsell: Nutrition course
You can’t out-exer cise a bad diet…so you’r e gonna want our course on
nutrition.
Important Notes
Actually Do It. You’d be amaze d how many businesses come to me and
only sell one thing. I usually just tell them “You barely have a business—
you have a front end. Figure out what you’re gonna offer next.” Mont hs
later, I hear they actually  5x’d their busin ess because they actually  offered
an upsell.
Offer  More Profitable Upsells  First. If I offer two products and one has
a higher profit than the other , I of fer the higher profit option first.
Get Them To “Say No To Say Yes.” I was always amazed at how often
the fur coat dealer got people to buy stuff by saying “no.” He knew people
had been trained to say “no” in response to “you don’t want anything else
do you?” But this actually turns a “no” into “yes.” So when upselling, the
question translates to: You don’t want anything [besides what I just offered]
do you? Clever salesmanship. So let the nos ( yeses ) roll in.
Surprise And Delight. Let’s say you have four bonuses you save to add
to get people who are on the fence to buy. Add one at a time. If they say yes
before you add them, still give them all four. It will surprise and delight
them. And, it guarantees you still sell the same thing to everyone so no one
feels left out later .

Sell More When They’r e Buying More—Hyper  Buying Cycle . Most
buyers enter a “hyper buying” cycle when they decide to do something new.
It’s a short window of time when they are the most excited about a new
thing they’re gonna do. This is when they spend a huge chunk of money in
a short period of time. Think  weddings, starting new hobbies, having
babies, moving to new places, and so on. If you have a business that caters
to these sorts of problems, don’t shy away from Upsell Offers. Embrace
it...and keep making offers.
Use Free Bonuses To Create Problems Upsell Offers Solve. Bonuses
solve problems.  That’ s what makes them valuable. And because of the
problem-solution cycle, they can also reveal them. Upsells can solve that
new problem. The ear muffs, for exam ple, cost materials and labor . But they
were able to ‘give them for free’ by getting customers to pay $30 to store
something they just got for fr ee.
The Faster People Get Access To Stuff, The More They’ll Value It. A
$10,000 thing you get later is worth less than a $10,000 thing you get now.
The longer it takes someone to access something, the less value it has in the
moment. So if you want to raise  the chance of them taking the upsell, make
it availa ble as soon as you can. Bonus points if you put it in their hands
before they’ve said yes. It’s way harder to give something back  than it is to
say no.
If You Bundle Upsells, Name Them. It’s easier to sell someone one thing
than nine things . By bundling items together , you can make one ‘ask’  and
get nine sales. I name the pack ages based on customer type and/or  result.
For example, “Fastest results” bundle or “Transformation package” or
“Minimum package.” All of these will boost upsells-per -person. Last, you
can “peel” some of the products or features out of the package as a way to
downsell. More on that in Section IV : Downsell Of fers.
Integrate Upsel ls Into Your Other Offers.  Make stuff you upsell part of
how you deliver other offers. Then, more customers will take them. My
meal plans included optional supplement suggestions. So when I went over
nutrition, people asked about supplements. Gym Launch sales and
marketing traini ng suggested optional softwares. This led gym owners to
buy them . Integ rate the next thing you wanna sell into the first thing they
buy.
Make Sure You Book-A-Meeting-Fr om-A-Meeting (BAMF AM). The
more times you can upsell, the more people you will upsell. If you upsell

more people, you make more money . Since you want that…end every
appointment by scheduling the next appointment. Don’ t let them leave
without bookin g! As my big fancy public CEO friend Sharran says:
“A customer should know the next time they see you—and why— befor e
they leave. ” So if you agree to meet again , agree on why and when right
then.
Upsell As Many Times As It Makes Sense To. The rental car agency had
lots of upsells. The burger place had lots of upsells. My gyms had lots of
upsells. Gym Launch had lots of upsells. Offer as many solutions as there
are problems you can solve. Don’ t be shy. If you can solve it, offer to. The
second worst thing that happens is they say no. The worst thing is if they
would’ve said yes but you never asked.
How To Upsell More Of The Same Thing 
So if you have two things and want to sell one, add a third option to
nudge the option you want them to buy. Movie theaters do this with
soda and popcorn. Here’s how:
Their Small - Medium - Large pricing works something like this:
A - Small - $5
B - Medium - $8 (Rather than the rational price of $7)
C - Large  - $9
Result: More people take large. People who will take the small option
will always take the small option. People who take the large will

always take the large. But the people who normally take medium will
now probably take the large. 
If you want to get more people to buy the medium option, you’d price
it like this:
Small - $6 (Rather than the rational price of $5)
Medium - $7
Large - $9
Result: This upsells more people into the medium option because now,
most people who would normally get a small, will get a medium.
Bottom Line: If you have a lot of customers buying small, you can
bump them to mediums. If you have a lot of customers buying the
medium, bump them to large. If you have a lot of customers buying
large, raise all your prices. 
Upsell Guarantees, Warranties, and Insurance.  Many businesse s offer
guarantees on products. Many businesses offer warranties on products.
Many businesses offer insurance  on products. You can upsell all of them. So
instead of doing  it for free, just add 5–50% onto the price in exchange for a
guarantee that your thing does what you say it will. Ex: An art studio used
to replace damaged portraits at no charge. I told them to start asking
customers if they would pay an extra 10% for it. Now , 30% of customers
buy stuf f the art studio used to give away for free. Pure profit baby .
Summary
Your Attraction Offer reveals a problem. Upsells (whatever you
offer next) solves it.
Use The Classic Upsell for immediate problems revealed by your
previous offer.
Asking “you don’t want anything else do you?” gets people to
agree by saying no. It works.
Increase the chance customers take upsells by giving them access
to it as soon as possible.

Give away bonuses that create an upsell opportunity. A great way
to make more cash.
To get more chances to upsell customers, make BAMFAM a way
of life.
You can have as many upsell offers as you want as long as you
solve problems.
You lose nothing by offering to solve someone’s problem.
If it makes sense for your business, you can charge for guarantees,
warranties, or insurance rather than give them away for free.
