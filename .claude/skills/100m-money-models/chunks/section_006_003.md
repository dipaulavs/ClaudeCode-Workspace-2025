# Feature Downsells

**Path:** Section IV: Downsell Offers/Feature Downsells
**Type:** section

Why don’ t we try this instead?
I can’ t remember when in 2019.
“This new down sell tripled my close rate from 25% to 75% last quarter .
And even crazier , more people bought the main thing,” he said between
bites.
“You start of fering a payment plan or a discount?”
“Neither . Payment plans take too long. And discounts devalue my
product.”
Huh… “We’re talking about a high-ticket product, right?”
“Yup.”
“Geez. What are you doing?
“I lower the price, but I justify it by cutting a feature. That way, I’m not
discounting.”
“So what feature did you cut?”
“My full money-back guarantee.”
“I never thought of guarantees as features, super intere–wait… you
downsell by r emoving  your guarantee? ”
“Yea. Works great. When we get a price objection we ask ‘If you don’t
want the option to get your money back, you can pay less. Or, you can keep
your money-back guarantee—which would you prefer?’  Once they
understand what they’d give up, they often say ‘Screw it, I’d rather keep the
guarantee and get my money back’.”
“Ahhhh…so they only see the value of the guarantee after  you remove it.
And that also explains why so many more are buying the main thing.
Clever .” Then I followed up, “...how do the numbers break down?”

“Before, I only had one full-price option. So if 100 people got on a call,
25 bought. Now , 35 people buy the main thing and 40 take the downsell.”
“So it upped your full-price buyers, total close rate, and up front cash.
Nice!”
“Yeah, it changed my life,” he said.

The last two chapters covered Payment Plan Downsells and Trial With
Penalty . We downsold by keepin g the overall price the same, only changing
when and how they paid.
In this chapter , we cover Featur e Downsells. With these, we downsell by
lowering the price. But instead of a discount, which makes the same stuff
cheaper , we lower the price by changing what they get.
Description
Feature Downse lls lower prices by changing what customers  get. I do
them by offering lesser quantity , lower quality , lower price alternatives, or
cutting optional components.
All features have a price and a value. If you remove something  the price
goes down, sure. But, the value  goes down too. What features you remove
and how much you lower the price affects how good of a deal the person
gets. This change in your offer’s price-to-value affects how people buy.
People wanna get the best deal for them .
For insta nce, if you remove stuff they hate, and lower the price a lot, they
get a better deal. If you remove stuff they love, and lower the price a little,
they get a worse deal. Both get people to buy. In the story , customers loved
the guarantee.  The guarantee had far more value than its price.  So even  if
they said no at first, removing the guarantee instantly showed its value. The
customers saw the higher -price offer as a better deal.  So, after seeing the
downsell option, they bought the first of fer.
People will see the value in the thing you removed after they see the
differ ence in price . As in, people weigh how much money they save against
how much value they lose. So, clever Feature Downselling gets customers
to “re-upsell” themselves on the more expensive offers. This means you
want to remove featur es from highest to lowest value.  Since people want

more value for their money , this incentivizes customers to make the highest
value  purchase for them.
Feature Downse lls have a simple formula: take something away , lower the
price, and in so many words ask “how about now?”
Feature Downsell Examples
Featur e Downselling Product and Service Quantity . For services, this
might mean a lower amount, fewer sessions, less time, or shorter duration.
For products, it means fewer of them.
Product Quantit y Downsell : Instead of a three-month supply , how about
we start with just one?
Service Quantity Downsell : Instead of four sessions per month, why don’t
we start you at two?
Featur e Down selling Product Quali ty. Think older versions, less
reliable materials, materials of lower social status, etc.
Product Quality  Downsell : Instead of the leather seats we can do vinyl,
how does that sound?
Featur e Downselling Service Quality . This means a lot of things. I will
give you a few ways I change the quality of services. Hint: This also works
to increase the service quality .
Service Quality Downsell : Instead of 5-minute response times, why don’t
we just start you at overnight response times? You’ll save some money and
you’ll still get your answers—just with a small delay .
More Service Quality Features :
Time Availability: Come specific times vs. whenever you want
Days of week: Mon/Wed/Fri vs. All Days
Times of day: 9 to 5 vs. 24hrs
Amount of time: 15min Support Calls vs. 60min Support
Calls
Location Availability: This one location vs. all locations we own
Cancellations: Reschedule fees vs. free
Speed Of Response: Reply in minutes vs. hours vs. days etc.

Speed Of Delivery: Wait in line vs. priority, same day/next day
vs. next week etc.
Service Ratio: One-on-one vs. one-to-many vs. many-to-one
Communication Method: Text Support vs. Chat Support vs.
Video Call Support etc.
Provider Qualifications: Owner vs. long-time employee vs. new
employee, etc.
Live vs. Recorded: Watch it happening now vs. watch it after it
happens later
In-Person vs. Remote: Watch where it happens vs. watch it
somewhere else
DIY, DWY, DFY. Do It Yourself vs. Done With You vs. Done For
You
Expirations: Works forever vs. works for X time vs. works at
specific times
Personalization: Generic vs. made just for you
Insurance/Guarantee:
Lengths of time: For One Year vs. For Life
Coverage: Specific bad thing happens vs. Any bad thing
happens
Terms: Unconditional vs. Only if you do XYZ
Downselling by Removing Entire Featur es. Rather  than lowering
quantity or quality , you remove the feature itself. In the story , he removed a
guarantee.
Removing Entire Feature Downsell : Instead of priority chat support,
email support, and calls, why don’t we just keep chat and email support but
drop the calls to save you some  money? You’ll still get your answers, it’ll
just save us time and we can pass those savings to you.
Featur e Downs elling Done-For -You to Do-It-Y ourse lf. If someone says
no to all your service downsel ls, you can downsell another product that
solves the same problem.
Done-For -You to Do-It-Y ourself Product Downsell :

Chiropractor: Instead of chiropractic adjustments, let’s start you
with some tools you can use to do it yourself at home? Then,
you’d sell at home massage tools, foam rollers, mats, etc.
Painter: If you can’t afford me painting your house, why don’t I
just give you the paint and let you lease one of our spray
machines for a daily rate?
Alex Hormozi: Instead of me and my team buying your company
and actively growing your business, why don’t you just attend a
workshop? (*Cough* Go to acquisition.com)
Important Notes
Remember , Never  Negotiate The Price. People who demand to pay less
for the same thing are business terrorists. I don’t negotiate with terrorists. If
they want to pay less now—of fer a payment plan. If they want to pay less
overall—of fer a feature down sell. But don’t let anyone pay less just
because.
Maintain The Position Of A Helpful Guide.  Remember , Feature
Downselling means trying to find the best deal for them . This keeps the
conversation collaborative rather than competitive. If you act pushy , your
offers will exha ust customers faster . If you stay a helpful guide, you can
downsell as many of fers as necessary without exhausting the customer .
Tweak Your Featur e Downsell Process. We have the job of making the
product have the highest value- to-cost in the eyes of the customer . But, in
the beginning, you won’ t know much about your customers’  preferences.
So, as you solve  the same problems for the same type of customer , you’ll
learn what they find the most valuable. Once you do, you can standardize
your Feature Downsell process. Feature Downsells close more people when
you know what feature combinations to present ahead of time.
How I Standardize My Dow nsell Process. First, I cut something
valuable and lower the price a little. I do this to get them to reconsider the
original offer/pr ice. If that fails, I continue removing features and lowering
prices until they buy . I’d rather people get something  rather than nothing.
Name Your Featur e Combinations. Name the most expensive
combination after a status your customer would find aspirational, such as
“The Whale Package,” “The Total Transformation,” “High Roller” etc.

Look at airlines. Make your version of First Class →Business
Class →Economy .
I Name My Cheapest Combination “The Minimum.”  I like it because
it implie s they have to get at least  that thing. If someone rejects all other
packages, I just say “so nothing more than the minimum package then?” to
get them to say no to say yes (like the Classic Upsell).
Temperatur e Check After  Two Downsells (Like Payment Plans).  If
you make two changes in a row and they still refuse, make sure they really
want the thing. I’d say somethin g like “Got it. Real quick. I want to make
sure. On a scale fr om 1–10 how bad do you want this?”
If They Say 8 Or Above, Start Payment Plan Downselling . “Awesome.
Don’ t worry . We’re gonna figur e out a way to make this happen for you.”  If
they say 7 or below, ask “What would a 10 look like?”  and then, recombine
the featu res to try and accommodate their ‘10.’ Note: this means you can
alternate between payment plan and feature downsells. When you use both,
you become very dif ficult to refuse.
After  Each Downsell, Ask “Deal?” Or “Fair  Enough?” This works
astonishingly  well. Fewer people will see you change the offer for them and
then say “No that’s not fair.” Listen to how I present Feature Downsells on
Episode 202 of my podcast The Game, “How to close everyone:
downselling like a pro.”
Free Orientations Boost Do-It-Y ourself Featur e Downsells. Once
someone has refused all my Done For You offers, I ask “Even though we’re
not gonn a work together on X, I still want to help. How about you just come
to a free orienta tion on X tomorr ow?”  At the end of the orientation, I offer a
DIY product that solves the same problem as the DFY  service. For example
I offered a free orientation to people who refused my fitness offer. Of the
people who showed up to the orientation (about half), almost all of them
bought supplem ents. It got me money from people who would’v e otherwise
said no. Free money for little extra work.
Featur e Downs ell Your Guarantees.  If you already have a guarant ee,
make removing  it part of your Feature Downsell process. People value
security , so removing it gets many people to realize its value. This often
flips an initial ‘no’  back to a ‘yes.’
Featur e Downsell Curr ent Customers . Customers who use all the
features they pay for keep paying longer than people who don’t. So once

you see a customer isn’t using a feature, offer a lower price—only paying
for the features they use. They’ll either tell you they want to keep it and
might start using it again—or—they’ll be happy you gave them a better
deal. It takes work, but it beats them canceling. Fun fact: Custom ers who
we’ve downsold into a lower package just for them  have the second highest
value of all my customers. Whe n people have a product they like at a price
they find fair , they keep paying.
Barter  With Reviews, Testimonials, And Referrals. Bartering is the
oldest form of exchange. My sharp rock for your rabbit skin. And I love
bartering. If I get a price objecti on, sometimes I offer discounts in exchange
for advertising. Ex:“I’ll knock $100 off if you: 1) Leave me a review on all
review sites 2) Leave  me a video testimonial 3) Make a public social post at
the beginning, middle, and end of our program showing your progress 4)
Introduce me to two friends who you would want to do this with. Deal?”  To
me, the advertisi ng is worth more than the $100 discount. To them, the $100
is worth less than the advertising. Win-win.

Summary Points
Feature Downsells lower prices by removing stuff.
You take something away, lower the price, and ask “how about
now?”
Typical Feature Downsells offer Lesser Quantity, Lower Quality,
Lower Price Alternatives, or remove features altogether.
People tend to see the value in what you removed after they see the
price difference. This may get more people to take the more
expensive offer.
If you remove stuff they hate, and lower the price a lot, more
people take the downsell.
If you remove stuff they love, and lower the price a little, more
people take the original offer.
The first downsell gets them to reconsider my first offer. The rest
of my downsells get them to consider the best deal for them.
If a prospect rejects multiple downsells, see if they still want your
thing before continuing.
If a prospect likes a combination of features, but still doesn’t like
the price, start payment plan downselling. Very effective.
Feature downsell current customers before they cancel.
You can discount customers in exchange for them advertising your
business.
