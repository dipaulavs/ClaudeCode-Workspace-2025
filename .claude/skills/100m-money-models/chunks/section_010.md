You don’t become confident by shouting affirmations in the mirror: You
become confiden t by giving yourself a stack of undeniable proof that you
are who you say you ar e. Outwork your self-doubt.
An actual post I made on July 25, 2020. Befor e I made my life public.

Leila snapped this when I wasn’ t looking and I was like “DAYUM M I look
pensive AF” 😂
Anyways, this is the second time we’ve taken a private jet.
And...it was dope.
They figur e if you go down with the ship, your seatbelt won’ t save you.
Regar dless—to every entrepreneur who is disappointing their parents,
wives, husbands, friends, fake friends, and everyone else who doubts you.
#1 I AM YOUR BIGGEST  FAN.
#2 It’s about to get r eal, so get har d fast.
#3 You cannot lose if you do not quit. I used to repeat that to myself over
and over when I didn’ t want to keep doing it.
If you feel hope less...welcome to entrepreneurship. If you feel like you’ll
never make it...you’r e on the right path. If you feel like you’r e a
disappointment to everyone you know ...Keep. Moving. Forwar d.
Because at the end of the rainbow isn’ t a pot of gold.
It’s you.

The r eal you.
That’ s been underneath all along whispering in your ear—just one more
step....one mor e call...one mor e sale.
When I say I’m your biggest fan, it’s because I was there. And I know you
because I know EXACTL Y what that FEELS like. Having both 100%
confidence and 1,000% doubt. At the same time. Her e’s all you gotta do:
Just keep moving.
Keep fighting.
Keep impr oving.
Your time will come.
Success is the only r evenge.

So right now you might be wher e I was back when I started. Working in a
concrete coffin, under blinding fluorescent lights, wanting to escape. You
might be overwhelmed by all the stuff you have to do to succeed. But with
that uncertainty , know that every entrepreneur , past and present, shoulders
the burden with you. I’ve been there. They’ve been there. You are not alone.
I share these stories as I experienced them so you can benefit from them as I
have.
So here’ s my promise: follow the lessons, the money will come.
Be one of zero.
