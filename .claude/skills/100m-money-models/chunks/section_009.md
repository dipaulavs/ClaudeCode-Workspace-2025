Where Money Models Fit In The Grand Scheme
Of Things
My first book, $100M Offers, answer ed the question: What should I sell?
Answer: an offer so good people feel stupid saying no. My second book,
$100M Leads , answered the next natural question: How do I find these
people?  Answer: You advertise. This book, $100M Money Models , answers
the next natural question: How do I get them to buy it? Answer: A Mon ey
Model.
What We Covered
We’ve covered a lot. And I think organizing what we learned into one
place helps it sink in. So I made this “back of the napkin” list of what we’ve
covered and why .
1. A Money Model is a series of offers designed to increase how many
customers you get, how much they pay, and how fast they pay it.
2. A good Money Model makes more profit from a customer than it
costs to get and service them in the first 30 days. That’s the bare
minimum.

3. A $100M Money Model makes more profit from one customer than
it costs to get and service many customers in the first 30 days, which
removes cash as a limiter to scaling your business.
4. Money Models have four types of offers: Attraction Offers, Upsell
Offers, Downsell Offers, and Continuity Offers.
5. Attraction Offers get customers by offering something free or at a
discount. Often, they also make money by offering a better deal at a
higher price. We covered five.
a. Win Your Money Back: You set a goal for the customer and
tell them how to reach it. If they reach it, then they qualify to
get their money back or get it back as store credit.
b. Giveaways: You advertise a chance to win a big prize in
exchange for contact information and anything else you
want. After picking a winner, you offer everyone else the big
prize at a discounted price.
c. Decoy Offers: You advertise a free or discounted offer.
When the lead asks to learn more, you also present a more
valuable premium offer. The premium offer includes more
features, benefits, bonuses, guarantees, and so on.
d. Buy X Get Y Free: You offer customers free stuff in
exchange for buying other stuff for money. The more free
stuff and the higher its value, the more people buy.
e. Pay Less Now or Pay More Later: You give people a choice
to pay full-price later OR pay a discounted price now and
get additional bonuses.
6. Upsell Offers are whatever you offer next. Typically, more, better, or
newer versions of what they just bought. These get you more cash
fast. We covered four.
a. The Classic Upsell: You offer the solution to the customer’s
next problem the moment they become aware of it. You can’t
have X without Y!
b. Menu Upsells: You tell customers which options they don’t
need. Then, tell them what they do need and how to get their
value from it. You don’t need that…you need this.

c. Anchor Upsells: You offer your most expensive thing first. If
the customer balks, you offer a much-cheaper-and-still-
acceptable-alternative. No worries. If you don’t care about X,
this may be a better fit for you.
d. Rollover Upsells: You credit some or all of a customer’s
previous purchases toward your next offer. Since you already
spent $500, I’ll just credit that towards you staying a full
year.
7. Downsell Offers are whatever you offer after someone says no. And
by turning Nos into Yeses you make more money. We covered three.
a. Payment Plan Downsells: You offer the same product at the
same price, but they pay some now and the rest over time.
When do you get paid? Let’s do half now and half then?
b. Trial With Penalty: You let customers try your product or
service for free so long as they meet your terms. If they do,
they have a better chance of becoming paying customers. If
they don’t, they pay. If you do X, Y, Z, I’ll let you start for
free.
c. Feature Downsells: You lower prices by changing what the
customer gets. I offer lower quantity, lower quality, lower
price alternatives, or cut optional components entirely. If
you’re okay without a guarantee, I can knock off $400.
8. Continuity Offers provide ongoing value that customers make
ongoing payments for—until they cancel. These boost the profit of
every customer and give you one last thing to sell. We covered three.
a. Continuity Bonus Offers: You give the customer an awesome
thing if they sign up today. Typically, the bonus itself has
more value than the first continuity payment. If you sign up
today, you also get XYZ valuable thing.
b. Continuity Discount Offers: You give the customer free time,
now or later, if they sign up today.
c. Waived Fee Offers: First, you ask the customer to pay a
startup fee as part of joining a month-to-month program.
Then, you offer to discount the entire fee if they commit

longer term. If they cancel inside the term, they pay the fee.
9. You build Money Models one stage at a time.
a. Once I get customers reliably then I make sure they pay for
themselves reliably then I make sure they pay for other
customers reliably then I start maximizing each customer’s
long-term value. Then, I print as much money as I can.
Bottom Line:  The knowledge in these bullets  brought me more free and
profitable customers than I’ve known what to do with. If executed, they will
do the same for you. And with that, cash will no longer constrain your
business. I hope this book helps  you grow your dream as big as you darn
well please.
Also, since you are one of the few who actually finish what you start, I
want to leave you with a parting gift: some closing remarks that got me
through hard times.
