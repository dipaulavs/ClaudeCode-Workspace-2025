Time is money . - Benjamin Franklin
June 2016.
A headli ne caug ht my attention: “Double your reading speed in 3 hours,
or it’s free.” I opene d and scanned the text. Inside, the world’ s fastest reader
offered a free training to doub le my reading speed in three hours. So, I
registered. Why not?
The registration page said, “You can put your credit card down for $0, and
get billed $297 tomorrow . And if your reading speed doesn’ t double, just
email us before  then and we’ll cancel the charge. But you must attend in
order to be eligible.” or “You can just pay $97 right now, and as a free
bonus, get the recordings, which won’ t be for sale anywhere else.”
I decided on the first option. I wanted to see if my reading speed doubled
before paying for anything. The whole training I expected him to sell me
more stuff. But he simply provided value. After two hours, using his tactics,
my reading speed doubled. Impr essive . The training had been true to the
promise. He earned his $297.
After that, he talked about how I could learn to read even faster with his
eight-week training program. I was satisfied with my results, so I chose not
to take the upsell. He taught me a skill I still use to this day. But, the true
value came from learning a brand new Attraction Of fer.

Description
In Pay Less Now  or Pay More Later , you give people a choice to pay full-
price later OR pay a discounted price now. This play works so well because
we remo ve all risk from the customer . They pay later and only if they like
it. So it combines the benefits of a delayed payment and a satisfaction
guarantee. Anyone can sell this. Almos t anyone  will agree to pay later if
they are satisfied. But, once they agree to pay later, you can get them to pay
now with hefty discounts and valuable bonuses.
The pay later option allows you to advertise “free” since they can choose
to pay or not. This gets lots of leads engaged. But this free offer has an
added benefit— we get their card on file. If they choose this option and hate
the product, then they can cancel any time before the char ge goes through.
If they accept the pay later  option, we make a follow up offer to pay now.
Pay now options provide a 20–50% discount and greater bonuses. And
since we already have their card on file, we make it easy for them to pay .
Whether they choose to pay now or pay later, you’ve got customers, and
likely , some profit. But, to take full advantage of this offer, you’ll want
something else to sell. So have something more, better, newer to offer when
the time is right. And don’ t worry , we go deep on upsells in the next section.

Important Notes
Promise A Clear  Yes/No Result. First, make your promise a clear ‘yes or
no’ result. Secon d, make sure you can deliver on it within your time frame.
If you don’t, they will ask not to be billed. Duh. For example, if you
promise to decrease someone’ s shoulder pain, have them rate their pain 1–
10 before you do your magic, then ask them to rate it after. If it went down,
you’ve succeeded and you can sell them something else. Keep the promise
simple, clear , and measurable. This avoids unnecessary cancellations.
Make a Conditional  Satisfaction Guarantee. People can only cancel the
billing if they qualify. For example, I had to show up to the reading training
to qualify to cancel the charge. After all, they can’t say you suck if they
never try it. So, be sure to track  the conditions necessary to qualify . Think:
attendance, showing up to an appointment, turning in data, etc. Make the
criteria what people do to get the most value out of the product. Win-W in.
Bonuses For Your ‘Pay Now’  Option. I hate when people repeat content
and call it new. So I didn’ t want to be like that. I dedicated an entire chapter
to bonuses in my offers book: $100M Offers . You can grab a copy of the
book, or watch the video training on my site for free at:
acquisition.com/training/of fers.
Optimizing Your ‘Pay Now’  And ‘Pay Later ’ Offer . If too many people
take your ‘pay later’ option, discount the ‘pay now’  option more, add better
bonuses, or both. If too many people take your ‘pay now’  option, do the
opposite.
If More Than 10% Of ‘Pay Later ’ People Cancel Their  Payment . You
promised too much, the guarant ee conditions are too low, or the price is too

high. Note : No matter how well you deliv er, some  people will cancel their
payment. That’ s okay . Factor it in your costs of doing business and live
your life.
This Works For Recurring Revenue Businesses Too. You just give them
the optio n to pay a higher ongoing rate 30 days later or they pay less today
and keep the lower rate for good. Plus, add in some bonuses.
If You Run Events/W orkshops/Pr esentations, Hint At Your Next
Offer  Early .
If the reading guru had said “Everyone want s to know when my
next reading intensive starts because they sell out so fast. I’ll get to it
at the end. But please pay attention. I want to deliver on the promise I
made to you guys to double your reading speed first.”  By hinting
about his next offer earlier , he would’ve sold more of it. Let me
explain:
I used to do a lot of nutrition consultations. People would
interrupt me all the time to ask about supplements. It annoyed
me. So one tired day I spouted “everyone wants to know what
supplements to buy. We’ll get there—I promise. But please pay
attention to the nutrition sectio n—it matters more.” By accident, I
implied everyone bought supplements without offering them. And
all the head nods I got showed they actually did want more
products. All these factors got more people to buy when  they
finally got to ask. A happy mistake I made sure to repeat.
Summary Points

bonuses…if they pay now.
The Pay Later option has a delayed payment with a conditional
guarantee.

value from the product.
The Pay Now option offers a 20–50% discount and bonuses if they
pay now.
