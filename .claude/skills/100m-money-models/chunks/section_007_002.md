Spring 2018.
Leila and I had just moved into one of the nicer Austin suburbs. On our
afternoon walk,  a neighbor smiled and waved us over. It looked like she
wanted to make “welcome to the neighborhood” small talk. I hate small
talk. But as I got closer , I got more interested. The yard was perfect. A
Ferrari stuck out of their garage  for “spring cleaning.” The patio table was
littered with cigarettes and beer cans. Huh?
“Hi there, welcome to the neighborhood…let me get the husband.” I
smiled through gritted teeth. Here we go. Out came the character—in a
backwards hat, flip flops, with a strong midwest accent, speaki ng a mile in
a minute, and the widest grin you’ve ever seen.
“Hey brotherman! Nice to meetcha. I can tell yer no doctor or lawyer
livin’  here so young. So what kinda hustle you got?” He also got straight to
the point. Relief .
I told him a bit about my gyms, launching gyms, and the rise of Gym
Launch. He nodded with approval. He said he liked having another business
owner on the street.
“What about you?” I asked.
He smirked.“ Trash. ”
“What?”
“Trash. ”
He saw my confused look and continued.
“Alright, so ya see, I knew from my time workin’  trash there wasn’t much
competition. Big commercial places and all went to the same place for their
trash needs.”
“So what did you do?”

“Well, I had a truck, took my credit card, and I gambled.” He continued.
“I went to all the big apartments and said I’d do their trash for a whole year
free if they contracted me to do the next five years paid. It worked good
enough. They all made me their trash man before I knew it.”
“Dang,” I said. “Y ou fronted an entire year?”
“Uh-huh. And I’ll tell you what, it was the tough est thing I ever did. No
one would invest in my busines s, not even my family . They all called me
crazy . But after that one year mark passed, the cash came floodin’. I ate real
fat then. And after a few years usin’  that plan, I sold the whole shebang for a
pretty penny .”
“Nice, man. I never would’ve thought there was so much money in trash.”
“There’ s cash in trash baby , what can I say. Oh yeah…you want a beer, or
what?”
Needless to say , we’ve stayed friends to this day .

Listening to his success showe d me the sheer power of a simple offer
done right. That said, let’s go over some important stuff so you can make it
work like he did.
Also, if you think this looks like “Buy X Get Y Free” done continuity-
style, then you’d be right. However , there are enough difference s specific to
continuity that it justified its own chapter .
Description
To make a one-time continuity discount, you give products or services
away for free if the customer commits to buying more products and services
over time. This can attract  loads of potent ial customers and makes an easy
sale anyone can close.
If you look around, you’ll see this offer in many different industries. It
works. Think internet, pool cleaning, gym memberships, landscaping, and
anything rentabl e. I mention common ones, but you can make this work in
any business so long as you know two things. First, how you’ll apply the
discount—I do it four ways. And second, your cancellation policy—because
people don’ t always keep their commitments.

Examples
I discount in four ways: Up front, at the end, an even spread, or after the
first month or two.
Up Fron t. You apply the discount up front and push out the term. As in,
the “official” time starts after their free time ends. This works best in
industries that have a successful history of enforcing contracts (cell phones,
storage, real estate, equipment, or anything with collateral). Two notes:
First, if you have historically high churn, then skip this one and consider the
others. Second, this does not get customers profitably . It gets customers, but
delays cash. So if you want more profitable options, continue on.
At The End. You can apply the entire discount at the end and push out the
term. So long as they make every payment on time…they get a bonus time
equal to the value of the discount. They earn their free time.

Spread Over Time. Apply the discou nt across the term. Say you give three
months free for a one-year commitment. At $200 per month you’ve
discounted $600 . By spreading that $600 over 12 months, they get a
$600/12 months = $50 discount each month. You can also tell them that if
they make all their payments on time, they can keep the discount for life
after the term is over .
After the first 1–2 payments.  They pay a few times and then they get their
one-time discou nt. This way you collect a bit of cash to cover  advertising
and some delivery costs. I prefer to do it by presenting the offer as “first
and last month, ” “last month up front,” or adding some sort of activation

fee before getting the bonus value. It also ensures the customer uses a valid
form of payment…a small but important detail when you run a business.
Important Notes
**Highest Value Per Word Note In This Book** Skip this if you hate
money . Bill weekly (weekly , every 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks etc). Here’ s
why. There are 12 months in a year, but the year has 13 four-week cycles.
That’ s an 8.3% differ ence.  If I offer my thing at “$100 every four weeks”
(versus $100 a month) the same  number of people buy. But, I make 8.3%
more annually . To put this into perspective, if your busines s has 20%
margins, this skyrockets annual profit by 41%. And the best part is, you
don’t do any more work. Just change a few words. What else can you do
legally that makes so much money for so little work? This has literally
made me millions in pur e profit. So yeah, do it.
Don’t Eat Into The Term With Discounts, Extend Them! Let’s say you
offer three months free when you sign up for a year. That could  mean they
pay for nine months then get three free (12 total months). Or, that could
mean they pay 12 months and get three free (15 total months). I prefer to
start with extending the term. Then, I can Feature Downsell a shorter one.
Get 3% More Revenue For Five Extra Words.  “Yea, it’s $X plus a 3%
processing fee.” In my life, I’ve never had anyone not buy because of a
processing fee. But 3% added  to your topline for no extra work goes
straight to your bottom line. If you run a 10% profit business, and add 3%,
you just added 30% to your profit. Worth it. And this works especially well
when paired with…
Get Two Forms Of Payment. Recurring businesses lose mountains of
cash because of payment proces sing problems. First, customers don’t cancel
but their payment information changes or expires. Second, customers max
out cards or have insuf ficient funds. We fix both issues with the same
solution. I ask them if they want a 3% discount (a pretty standard
processing fee). “Do you want to save the processing fee? …awesome. Give
us a second form of payment in case anything happens to the first one.”  If
they ask why, which they rarely do, just say “We only have the processing
fee beca use it costs us man hours to get new payment inform ation every

month from our customers. So if you save us time, we pass the savings onto
you.”
Get ACH If You Can.  If you get a second form of payment, try to get
ACH. This is a form of payme nt that links directly to their bank account.
It’s the cheapest  way to transact besides cash. If you don’t know what ACH
is, look it up.
Gift Cards.  Give the discou nted time in the form of a physical gift card.
You can mail it to them if they are out of the area. The customer can apply
the discount whenever they want after the first three payments or so. Then
you can say they can also gift it to a friend if they want. And now you’ve
got a lead magn et! Beyond that, many people simply forget to use it. In that
instance, you just got a full-priced sign-up. Nice!
Try Lifetime Discount At Your Most Common Churn Point. You
advertise the lifetime discount. But, you make customers earn it. They  get a
lower rate if they stay past X period. Make X the month your average
customer drops of f.
Let’s say you know every custo mer stays four months on avera ge. You’d
tell everyone up front  they get a lifetime discount after month four. As the
time approaches, tell them their new lower rate is right around the corner .
Real world example: I saw a rice company selling (a lot) of rice. They
offered three pricing options: 1) a one-time price 2) a 5% off subscription 3)
15% off if you stayed on the subscription for five straight months.  You
earned the lifetime lower rate. I’m sure they figured out that it was just
beyond where most people canceled.
CANCELLA TIONS
You Need To Have A Cancellation Policy Figur ed Out Ahead  Of Time.
There are many common ones. 30 or 60 days notice. Cancellation fees.
Cancel anytime. Etc. Since everyone comes into my Continuity Offers on a
discount of some kind, this is my favorite:
Just make the cancellation fee equal to the discount they agreed to get. So
if they got $600 in discounts by committing, they can pay $600 whenever
they want to cancel. This is simple to explain.
Make Sure Customers Know How To Cancel. If customers have
nowhere to complain inside your business, they will definitely complain

outside  of your business. If you have no obvious way for them to cancel,
more people will vanish and complain. By having a clear way for them to
contact you, then you can have  a real chance to save it. Small businesse s
don’t get rich by making stuff hard for their customers. If you make it easy,
you’ll suffer fewer 1-star reviews and have a chance to save them when
they do—because you’ll know about it.
If A Customer  Wants To Cancel, Ask To Do An Exit Interview . Some
people like to vent. Let them. Get more angry about the problem than them.
They may try to calm you down . Sometimes, they will save themselves! If
they complain about something you can solve then, by golly , solve it. And if
they wanted a better product, do a rollover upsell into a higher level of
service if you have one to offer. I’ve had many people buy a lower cost
offer and then complain because  they wanted the higher cost features. So I
offer higher cost features, and they buy . Yes. It happens. And yes, it works.
Use Cancellatio n Fees To The Customer ’s Advantage. I might say “I’ll
waive your cancellation fee if you come in and tell me what I could do
better .” This gives customers a real reason to give feedback. Then, I can use
their feedback to fix the problem—or—of fer something bette r suited for
them. At the very least, they’ll have nicer things to say about the business if
I actually try to solve the problem. I routinely save a third of customers that
agree to exit interviews.
Summary Points
Continuity Discount Offers give continuity time for free if the
customer signs up today.
Frontloaded discounts convert more customers, but may have
higher churn.
Backloading discounts converts fewer customers, but they lower
churn.
Spreading the discount keeps cash flowing while providing the full
discount.
Use gift cards to give the discount to new customers and allow
them to gift it to a friend or use it on themselves at a later date. You
get a full priced sign-up and a referral!

Allow customers to earn a lifetime discount at your month of
greatest churn to encourage customers to stick through it for a
lifetime lower rate.
Light cancellation terms get more people to sign up but more
people leave. Harsher terms get fewer sign-ups but fewer leave. I
prefer customers cancel by paying the discount they got with their
commitment. This puts them back at the month-to-month rate.
Make sure customers know how to cancel.
If a customer wants to cancel, ask for an exit interview. Incentivize
them by saying you’ll waive the cancellation fee if they do. You’ll
often be able to save or upsell them from the conversation. At the
very least, you understand what went wrong so you can get better.
