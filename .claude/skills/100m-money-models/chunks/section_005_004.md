Wanna just r oll it forwar d?
June 2014.
I had been runni ng a Win Your Money Back Offer (Attraction Offer #1) at
my gym for the last year. A $600  fitness program where members could win
their money back— if they hit a goal . It crushed. I sold tons of them.
But there was a problem. Good gyms have lots of recurring revenue. I had
none.  Most winners put their $600 toward three months of membership.
Fine. But then they churned out before their first out-of-pocket payment. So
I essentially sold “buy six weeks get three months free.” Then, they’d leave.
Not fine.
That $600 thing  was my only source of income. So even though I got a
bunch of people in the door, my revenue started at zero every month. It was
stressful. I had to figure out a better way to boost profit.
That’ s when my friend Justin posted how he added another  hundre d
members to his recurring revenue. He also attracted customers with a Win
Your Money Back Offer. But there was one difference: my customers left,
and his kept buying stuff. So, I invited myself over to spy on him. He was
totally cool with it. I spent two days there. He and I ran some things
differently , but nothing that explained why he was doing so much  better
than me.
“Do you get lots of people winning their money back?”
“Yeah,” he said.
“Then how do you deal with all the free time you have to give away?”
“Free time? Ha! I just roll over their winning s into a year long
membership.”

“What?”
“Yea—we have to do that so we can spread the money out.”
“Spread the money? What are you talking about?”
“Seriously? What—you give it all up front?” He didn’ t wait for me to
answer . “We just give them fifty bucks of f per month for a year .”
“So even though they won their money back, they start paying
immediately?”
“Of course. I don’t want people not paying. What sort of busine ss doesn’ t
have paying customers??” He laughed. “They still get their money back…it
just takes a year .”
Boom. This was it. The missing link in my Money Model.

This one thing, the Rollo ver Upsell, changed my life, thousands of gym
owners’  lives, and the lives of our customers. The Rollover Upsell changed
everything .
Now , instead of hoping  customers spend money again, I roll over the cost
of what they just bought towar d the next thing.  And when paired with more
expensive of fers, it skyrockets 30-day profits.
And although I learned the Rollover Upsell this way, you don’t need a
Win Your Money Back attraction offer to use it. You can Rollover Upsell
anyone  anything . (Even stuff people bought at other businesses…
mwahaha).
Description
Rollover Upsell s credit some or all of a customer ’s previous purchases
toward your next offer. And this—in my experience—gets way more people
to take it. So once I know how much credit to give, I figure out three things:
who to upsell, what  to upsell, and how to roll over the credit.
For the who, I use Rollover Upsells in four situations:
First, to re-engage customers who left a while ago.
Second, to rescue upset customers as a better alternative to a refund.
Third, to ‘rescue’  other people’ s upset customers.
Fourth, to upsell regular customers.

For the what , remember , you can upsell more of what they just got,
something bette r, or something new and differ ent. To make money: Roll
their credit over to something more expensive.
For the how, you can apply all or part of the discount up front or spread it
over time.
Examples of Rollover Upsells
Chir opractor:  Re-engage old patients with a “W inback” Campaign
Who : Custom ers With Six Months Since Last Purchase What : New Plan
How : Up front.
Reach out to your old patients. Look at their purchase history . Offer to
apply some or all of their past purchases towards something more expensive
than what they bought.
Ex: “Hi Mrs. Banks, I wanted to give you your money back, do you have a
minute? Great, yea. I wanted to see how your back pain is going? Oh, I’m
sorry to hear that. Well, I have some good news. As a way of saying thank
you, I want to give you $500 of your money back as credit towar ds staying
pain-fr ee for good. Is that of any inter est? Gr eat…let’ s get you in…”
Dentist: Save Y our Own Upset Customer W ith Rollover Upsell
Who : Upset Customer What : Teeth Whitening How : Front Load $200
Credit.
The person pays $200 for teeth cleaning but doesn’ t think their teeth got
whiter . We explain they need more to get more and upsell into a teeth
whitening packa ge which includes multiple sessions, an at-home kit, and
multiple deep cleanings. You offer to credit the $200 they paid for the
cleaning towards the whitening package.
Softwar e: Rescue (*Cough* Steal) Other People’ s Upset Customers
Who : Competitors’  customers What : Service agreement How : Rollover cost
to break old agreement.
You find competitors’  upset customers and credit the customers’  old
purchases with them towards a new purchase with you. Roll over the
amount they owe with them as credit towards a longer agreement with you.

Ex: “Hi John, I saw your negative review on their product and it really
upset me. To make it up to you, I’ll credit whatever payments you have left
with them to switch to ours. This way, you don’t lose a thing and you start
getting the benefits now . Fair enough?”
Membership : Spread First Pur chase Over a T erm
Who : Current customers What : 12-month membership How : Spread out
first purchase.
Somebody buys  a small block of service or membership time. As soon as
they do, you can offer to apply the entire amount towards more time—like
12 months. I can do the rollover upsell at any time, I just prefer to do it right
then. When you do, you take the first purchase’ s cost and apply it as a
discount over the longer agreement. For example, a $600 first purchase
makes a $50 per month rollover discount for 12 months.
Important Notes.
Use Rollover  Offers To Attrac t New Customers.  For example, you roll
over some or all of what custom ers paid somebody else towar ds your thing.
You can find leads for this by scraping contact information from negative
product reviews where availabl e. Voila—a hot new list of leads who need
what you have. Bonus: Create a way for people to complain about products
in your industry (think any media where people can leave comments). Then,
Rollover Upsell all of them. Nasty .
Do Rollover  Upsells before refunding. This has saved me tons of
customers and cash. If you did a bad job (hey, it happens), roll over for a
‘do over.’ And if they want something different, roll over their purchase
toward that thing instead.
Previous Custo mers Are Still Customers. Upsell Them.  Reach out to
old customers (6+ months since last purchase). Look at how much they paid
before. Decide how much you’re willing to roll over. Offer it. Actually do
this. I called these “winback campaigns.” I made personalized videos for
200 past custom ers offering them $4,000 of credit to return. We got about
20% to take the offer. One day of recording videos got us an extra
~$1,900,000 of annual revenue. Worth It.

Add Urgency To Rollover  Upsells. Make Them One-T ime Only . If
you’re spicy , make the moment  you present the offer the time to take it. A
once-in-a-customer -lifetime offer. They don’t get to sleep on it. And yes, I
know they might not expect it. That’ s the point! You want to surprise and
delight. So if they want the credit, they’ve gotta take it now. If not, no big
deal. They can still pay full price later .
How To Price Your Rollover  Upsell. To make  money on a discounted
offer, you must have profit left after you discount it. Since I prefer to make
a profit, I try to make the upsell offer at least four times more than their
rollover credit. So even if I apply the whole amount of the first purchase, it
discounts 25% at most . Remem ber, the rules of discou nting apply . Bigger
discounts make you less profit per sale, but they get more sales.
You Don’t Need To Credit The Entir e Amount Of Their  First
Purchase . You can roll over as much or as little of the first purchase you
choose. I roll over whatever amount I think would incentivize them to buy
the next thing. Test to find the sweet spot.
My “Famous” Gift Card Play. You can use the Rollover Upsell as
an Attraction Offer for new and current customers by advertising gift
cards for 90%+ off. Ex: $200 Gift Cards for $20. Limit them to two
per customer and say they can only use them on other people. They
buy them as gifts and give them to their friends. This makes it a great
holiday offer. 

When customers buy the gift card, ask them who they want to make
it out to and if they’ll make an introduction. Then, when they come in,
roll their gift card over. Make the value of the gift card 20% of the
price of whatever you want to sell next. In our example, we sell a $200
gift card for $20. Then, apply that $200 value to an offer with at least a
$1,000 price tag. People pay you to refer their friends. It’s pretty great.
Plus, you get some pocket change from unused gift cards.
Summary Points
Rollover Upsells credit some or all of a customer’s previous
purchases toward your next offer.
To do Rollover Upsells, figure out who to upsell, what to upsell,
and how to roll credit over.
Who to upsell: old customers, upset customers, other people’s
upset customers, current customers.
What to upsell: more of something, something better, something
new or different. Just make sure you make a profit after applying
the credit.
How to roll credit over: Full or partial purchase price. Given up
front or spread out.
Price your next offer at least 4x higher than the credit. This makes
a 25% discount.
To get more takers, add urgency. Make your Rollover Upsell a one-
time only offer.
