# Continuity Offers Conclusion

The only thing better than getting someone to buy once, is getting them to
buy again.
Continuity Offers provide ongoing value that customers make ongoing

their bulk purchase. This way, I make even more cash and I get the
recurring-cash benefits of the other continuity customers.
Continuity Offers work with rewards or punishment. I prefer rewards.

situations, I like Waived Fee Of fers.

Continuity Of fers. Let’ s put a bow on it.

call to help gym owners use it. On the call I’d of fer:
