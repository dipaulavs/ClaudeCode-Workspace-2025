You don’ t need that…you need this
December 2013 .
People kept joining the gym like normal, but nobody cared about my
supplements. I read somewhere  keeping shelves full got more people to
buy. So I stocked my shelves with all the labels in a perfect row. It didn’ t
work. I also read if I told everyone about the cool science they would buy.
That didn’t work either . I got a few pitty purchases from loyal members, but
I was doing something seriously wrong. Why do I suck so much?
On a particularly rough day, I had nineteen nutrition consults, and nobody
bought anything. It was miserable. Then, appointment number twenty came
in. She had a nice purse and a big diamond ring on her hand. If I can’t sell
her, I should just quit trying.  But then I remembered… I’ve got $5,000 in
inventory on that shelf—I’ve gotta figur e this out!
We went through her nutrition consultation and I started getting nervous. I
got so nervous I forgot my script. And rather than blabbing about science

stuff, I just asked “You’ve got a protein shake for breakfast, do you like
chocolate or vanilla?”
“Which one’ s your favorite?” She asked.
“Chocolate.”
“Great. I’ll take one of those.”
Wait, what just happened? I didn’ t talk about the benefits or anything. I
just asked what she wanted…an d she told me! Taking the hint, I moved to
the next item.
“Do you want kiwi or strawberry lemonade pre-workout?”—then I
remembered her last question—“...I like strawberry lemonade.”
Smiling, “Great, I’ll take that one.”
I had more products, but sellin g two was a record and I didn’t want to
scare her away . I still had to ask for money . So I grabbed her membership
contract that already had her card on it and asked “You just wanna use the
card we have on file?”
“Yep—that’ s fine.”
After that conversation, I sold the next twenty customers in a row. At the
end of the day, I stared at my empty shelf in disbelief. I know how to sell
supplements.
Takeaway: I stumbled on two tactics that changed my upsell game
forever . First, the A/B Upsell —I ask which product they prefer rather than
whether  they want the product at all. Second, asking if they want to use the
card on file rather than asking them to take out their card again. I still use
both to this day .
August 2014.
Now , I closed sales left and right. Bing bang boom. Now it wasn’t exactly
big stuff, but I was selling consistently . Every month I’d start another group
of challe ngers. And like clockwork, I’d upsell $5,000 to $10,000 worth of
supplements. Not bad for a day’ s work!
But one day, I had a lady who just wouldn’ t stop asking questions. She
kept wanting more information. How to take them. How many . When. What
times. What if she was working. What if she was at home. Wha t if she was
at the gym. She was relentless. I was gonna be late for my next consult. So
finally , I just wrote step-by-step instructions on the back of some scratch

paper . Take one of these at night. Take two of these after lunch. Drink this
after your workout. Y ada yada yada.
I walked her through what I wrote and asked. “Make sense?”
Nodding. “Thanks!” She grabbed the paper and left.
My next appointment had overheard our entire conversation. As soon as
she sat down, she asked “do you think you could write it out like you did
for that other lady?” I tried not to let out a sigh— I failed . I was gonna be
late for my next consult again .
But, I did as she asked. This time, I wrote the instructions right on the
order form. Next to each item, I wrote how much to take and when. And
because I didn’ t want to push my appointments back another fifteen
minutes, I just went for the upsell.
“I got all your instructions here,  do you want to just use the card on file?”
I asked.
“Yea that’ s fine.”
Hot diggity dawg. She just bought all those produ cts…and I didn’ t even
ask her anything. I told her . And she did it.  Like magic.
I did this from that day forward, and my 30-day profits skyrocketed.
Takeaway: I learned detailed  and personalized  instructions upsell more
people than vague and general suggestions. I call this prescription upselling .
November 2016.
By now, I was on the road launching other people’ s gyms.  And that
included selling supplements. I sold thousands of people. I’d see 40 to 50 a
day. Two people. Every 30 minutes. 12 hours straight. My supplement-
selling marathons alone covered  the flight there, my hotel and advertis ing
costs. I got so good I’d run out of stuf f to sell. Today was one of those days.
I just sold a lady the last of four different products. In situation s like this,
I’d sell whatever I had left to the next customer . But before I could pitch,
she blurted out, “Can I just get what she got?” Oh boy .
I said “Sorry , I just ran out. But honestly , you can get something close at
the shop down the street for about $20 less. It’s not as good, but it’ll do OK
for the first month. Cool?”
“Thank you so much for helping me out.” She seemed so grateful. It felt
good. So I continued unselling .

“This other thing, same story . Again, not as good, but it’ll get you through
the first month.” She seemed so happy . I couldn’ t stop myself now. I started
unselling stuf f I wasn’ t going to sell her anyways.
“You’re not trying to gain weight, right?” I joked.
“Oh god no!” she laughed.
“Okay great. You won’ t be needing this,” crossing out the weight-gainer
shake. “Oh, and you aren’ t trying to boost your testosterone right?”
“No haha. I don’ t think so,” she said.
“Great. You won’ t be needing this either .” I crossed it out. Then, I started
making suggestions from what I had left. “Okay . So you’re gonna need to
take two of these…three of these …” and I went on. She loved it and bought
without hesitation .
Takeaway: I went out of my way to cross out what she didn’ t need. And
this built enough goodwill to upsell what she did. Later, I kept products just
to cross them out!  I call this process unselling .
Description
In a Menu Upsell, you tell customers which options they don’t need.
Then, tell them what they do need, their preferences, and how to get their
value from it. Menu Upsells combine up to four tactics: Unselling,
Prescription Upselling, A/B Upselling, and Card On File.
First, I unsell  what customers don’ t need.
Second, I prescribe  what they do need.
Third, I ask their preferences between A and B .
Last, I make buying easy by asking if they want to use the card on file .
Unselling. You unsell by telling customers what they don’t need so that
you can emphasize what they do. Here, instead of asking if they want to
buy it or not, you explain what they don’t need  as a way to get them
excited about what they do. Unsells vary based on the customer ’s needs.
When  some options work best, you can cross out the rest. After telling them
what they don’t need…

Prescription Upsell. We tell them what they do need. Prescription Upsells
work well when  offering a choice is inconvenient and you have only one
thing that solves the problem. Prescription upselling has two important
components. First, you have to explain how it integrates with offers they
already bought. Second, you personalize and detail how to maximize its
value. Here, instead of asking if they want to buy it or not, you explain how
to use it as if they alread y have. Again, we remove the option of not buying
to lower  the chance they don’t buy. And once I have told them exactly how
they’re going to use everything…
A/B Upsell. We ask them their preferences. A/B Upsells work for multiple
offers that solve the same problem . You make A/B Upsells by asking their
preference. Inste ad of asking if customers wanted to buy a product, yes or
no, we ask whic h product they prefer : A or B. Either choice results in an
upsell. Basically , when you give people the option to not buy, some don’t
buy. So, I give the option to pick between buying two similar things. Once
they know what  they’re buying and how they’re gonna use it, I suggest the
easiest way for them to pay…
Card On File. A cherry on top of all this upsell goodness. I literally ask,
“Do you want to use the card on file?” Here, instead of asking if they want
to pay or not, you refer  to ways they already have. This gets more people to
buy because it lowers the “hidden costs” of buying. Picking which card to
use. Taking it out. Being reminded of ugly buying decisions in the past.
Even the hassle of buying stuff in a rush…and who knows how many more.
Just know if you make it easy for people to buy , more people will.
This took me ten years to learn. May you get the same value in ten minutes.
Examples
Massage Therapist
Unsell: We have a lymphatic massage available, but you’re not
pregnant or just out of surgery right? So we can cross that out.
Prescribe: Since your shoulder hurts we’ll heat you up first, then
hit your trigger points, and after that, we’ll do some dynamic
stretches.

A/B: So would you rather do it before work or on the way home?
Card On File: Wanna just use the card on file?
Dog Food
Unsell: You’re not gonna need this small bag or this puppy stuff—
you’ve got a big dog! You don’t need these vitamins either because
the food already contains them.
Prescribe: You’re also gonna wanna give your dog one of these
joint chews at each meal. And every 90 days, give them one of
these wafers for heartworms. Also, make sure to bring him back
next month. Let’s get that booked now.
A/B: So does your dog prefer beef or chicken flavor?
Card On File: Wanna just use the card on file?
Digital Product
Unsell: You don’t need all eight courses yet. You just need to solve
X, Y, & Z. Tell ya what. I’ll send you some free stuff that’ll solve
problems X and Y. Then, you’ll just need one course for problem
Z…
Prescribe: But to solve Z, you’re definitely gonna wanna do the
course this particular way. Can you put an hour a day towards it?
Okay—great. This will prevent any other Z problems cropping up
later.
A/B: Would you rather have direct message or phone support?
Okay great. And would you like to start today or Monday?
Card On File: Awesome. Wanna just use the card on file?

Pro Tip: “Card On File” for first purchases— What card do you
wanna to use?
Important Notes:
Make Anything  A/B Sellable.  You can turn anything  into an A/B offer.
Just to give you a few ideas…Q uantity (do you want one bottle or two?),
start dates (start tomorrow or Monday?), payment preferen ce (cash or
card?), flavors (chocolate or vanilla?), time slots (morning or afternoon?),
media (read or listen?), delivery speeds (standard or overnight?), sizes
(small or medium?), colors (black or white?), materials (paper or plastic?),
personnel (John or Sara?), communication (call or text?). With some
creativity , you can make anything  an A/B upsell.
If You Make An A/B Offer , Add A Nudge. If your customers have
limited experience with your products or service, give them a nudge. “This
is my favorite”  or “X is usually a safe bet” or “a lot of people love this”  or
“Tuesday’ s sessions are a little smaller if you like that”  or “Amy does great
with high schoolers.” These one-liners really help move sales along. (Hint:
If you want to move one particular product faster , nudge  that one more.)
If You’v e Sold Out Of It, Take Payment And Delay Delivery . Later I
learned I could just sell them stuff, order it, and set the expectation of when
it will arrive. This allowed me to sell way more selection because I didn’ t
have to carry inventory . If you run out, consider just collecting the cash and
changing the delivery expectations. You’d be surprised how well this works.
Employees Love Unselling. Employees often like helping custom ers
“game the system.” Let them. Encourage employees to help customers
game the system on purpose. Your employees have inside knowledge, so
allow them to show customers how to get the most value out of what you
have to of fer. Everyone wins.
See “The ‘Economist’  Play” below for a visual explanation.

If You Have Two Options And Want People To
Buy Both
In the late 1990’s The Economist magazine started offering a digital
subscription because more people got their news online. But, it also
wanted to keep its profitable print subscription. So, thinking people
would buy both, The Economist offered the following:
A- Digital Subscription: $59/year
B- Digital + Print Subscription: $125/year
Result: Print sales plummeted as customers flocked to the cheaper
option. Oops. 
To fix it, they added a decoy option for the same price as the bundle:
A- Digital Subscription: $59/year
B- Print Subscription: $125/year
C- Digital + Print Subscription: $125/year
Result: Customers now took the C - Digital + Print option $125/year.
Bottom Line: Present three options. Option A, Option B, and Option
C (Both)…but you make the price of (C) the same as the more
expensive option (B). So long as you price the options to preserve
your margins, you make the customer’s choice easy and sell both.

Summary Points
Menu Upsells work best when you have multiple offers available.
Menu Upsells combine up to four tactics:
Unselling: You tell customers what they don’t need.
Prescribing: Tell them what they do need.
A/B Offer: Ask them what they prefer.
Last, I make buying easy by asking if they want to use the
Card On File.
Unselling lower-margin stuff where appropriate incentivizes
higher-margin upsells.
Encourage employees to unsell and “game the system” on purpose.
Nudge new customers towards what makes sense for them.
