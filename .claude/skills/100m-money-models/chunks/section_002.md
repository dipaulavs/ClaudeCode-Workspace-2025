The world br eaks everyone and afterwar d many ar e strong at the br oken
places.  - Ernest Hemingway
Wher e I slept at my first gym: my “concr ete bedr oom.”
I stared at the ceiling in the dark, alone. I had no one to go to. It sounds
cool when you tell the story later , but it didn’ t feel that way . I was terrified.
I went against my father ’s wishes. I skipped out on business school. I
spent all my savings. Everyone I cared about told me not to do it. I was the
idiot that gave up on a good career .
I thought I would look forward to the struggle. But, it got real… fast.
Kids partied all night in the parking garage above me. They’d race over
the steel dividers. It sounded  like gunshots echoing in my concrete
bedroom. And as soon as I started to pass out, I’d get jolted awake by
another bang-bang bang-bang.
I finally gave up trying to sleep at night. I settled for midday naps—in the
utility closet. Then, in the dead of night, I worked. I had to make money .
My gym sat across the street from a large storage unit business. The
owner became one of my few members…only out of conveni ence. A few

weeks after he joined, he pulled me aside after his workout. “I’ve been
doing a little math,” he said, “It looks like you’re struggling.” I tried to hide
my embarrassment, but I failed. “Alright kid. Let’s grab breakfast
tomorrow .” I hesitated, thinkin g about my bank account. Before I could
answer , he said “...don’ t worry . My treat.” Relief.
The next morning we met at the local diner at around 5 AM.
As the waitress brought our coffee, he asked “How much time you got left
to live?”
“Huh?”
“How much cash you got saved up?”
“About five grand.”
“How much time does that give you before you run out?”
I thought about it for a moment. “About a month.”
“Tough. How you getting customers?”
“I have a $39 six-week special on a discount site.”
“How many customers have you gotten?”
“Four .”
“Looks like you’ve got a proble m…that you need to solve…fast.” He let
his statement sink in. Then I saw a grin spread across his face. “Let me ask
you a question… How much does a fr ee month of storage cost?”
I shrugged…“Uh, nothing?”
He took note of my confusion and said “Alright, let’s go for a ride. I’ll
explain it at my facility .”
As soon as we walked in, the girl at the front desk greeted us. “Good
morning, gentlemen!”
“Good morning, Judy . How much does a fr ee month of storage cost? ”
“$127 sir ,” she replied cheerfully .
He smiled and he turned to me. “Wanna know how?” I nodded. He took
me through the office and down one of the rows of freshly painted units.
“So, we advertise the first month as free, and it is. But what’ s the first thing
you need after you get a storage unit?”
“I don’ t know .”
“Exactly . Nobod y really does. But I do—and I help ‘em out. So let me
give you a hint…” He pointed towards the lock on the door .
“Right…a lock!”

“Yea, and not one of those flimsy locks kids use on their lockers. Those
won’ t fit anywa y. Besides, any goon with bolt cutters can get through ‘em
in a second…but not one of these bad boys.” He tapped the lock to
emphasize his point.
“Yeesh, it looks like it. Where do you even get one of those?”
“Funny you should ask. I’ve got a whole storage unit full of them.  Yours
today for just $47 bucks.”
“Okay , okay…I get it. They come in for the free month but what good is a
storage unit unless you can lock it?”
“Exactly ,” he said.
“I get it, so where does the other $80 come from?”
“Great memory . So, what else are you gonna want?”
I shrugged.
“Well, if you have stuff to store. You’re gonna need boxes  to store it in!
But, never fear. We’ve got boxes with tons of different shapes and sizes to
fit all your storage needs. We also offer tape, labels, and heavy duty
markers to make sure you know  exactly what’ s in every box and where you
put it. Super handy .”
“Oh, duh. That makes perfect sense.”
“What else are you gonna need?”
“I don’ t know…help moving it?”
“Yes! Now, we don’t actually offer in-house moving services. But, we
have an affiliate relationship with a local moving business and make a
kickback. And if you want to move all the stuff yourself, that’s fine too. We
have dollies, hand trucks, straps and other useful tools available …for a fee.
After all, why buy a bunch of stuf f you’ll only use once? What a waste!”
“Oh yea, didn’ t think of that.”
“What else are you gonna want?”
“Uh, I really don’ t know .”
“Well, what you store is valuabl e, right? At least, valuable to you in some
way. I mean, if it wasn’ t, you’d send it all to the dump! So…you’re gonna
want some insurance in case something bad happens. Now , I already give
$500 of free insurance to all customers. But if you have one of the special
locks only I offer , I’ll bump it to $100,000, for only an extra  $10 per
month.” He puf fed up with pride.

“Dang. And all that adds up to 127 bucks?”
“Yep. But, we’re not done yet. You know what always seems to happen?”
Onto his game now , I played along. “Beats me, what happens?”
“Everyone has way more stuff than they think. And they always  rent too
small of a unit! In fact, it happens so often we always  offer one size up.
They get the space they need and we make a few extra bucks. It works out
for everyone.”
“Wow. This is pretty cool. I didn’ t know any of this stuf f.”
“Of course not. Why would you?”
“Fair enough. But how can I use this to grow my gym?”
“Yeah. I’ve been playing this game as long as you’ve been alive. And
when you figure out how to make money in one business, and I mean really
figure it out, you see ways to make money in any business. And one thing’ s
for sure. The longer you play , the more you learn.”
“Wow, so you’ve had this place for 23 years?”
“This place, no. This one is one of my newer locations.”
“You have more than one?”
“I have 27.”
“Oh…crap.” I felt two inches tall.
“Anyways, I gotta get to work. You know your way out?”
“Yea,” I chuckled. “I think I can make it across the street.”
2.5 years later . . .
I now had six gyms. I had levele d up. And I wanted to level up again. So I
paid $25,000 for an hour of time with a famous marketer . I had never
spoken to him. But I knew his stuff like the back of my hand.  I had one goal
for this call—for him to help me scale my gyms.
After brief introductions, we dove in.
“...so, yeah, and that’s how I open my gyms at full capacity on day one. I
put $3,000 down for a lease and run a few day’s worth of ads. I sell
customers in the empty buildin g. Then the cash from those sign-ups goes
toward more ads, equipment, paint, flooring, furniture, signage, and
whatever else the location needs. Doing it this way, I’ve opened up a new
location every six months with no debt.”
“Wow—so cool! Explain it to me in a bit more detail, would you?”

His business was making a million bucks a month. Those numbers blew
my mind. And he wants to hear how -I- advertise?  I beamed with pride.
“I advertise a Free 6 Week Chal lenge until I get about 20 leads per day,” I
said.
“Got it, keep going,” he said.
“About half the leads show for appointments. I sell half of those who
show into a $600 program. So about 25% of my leads become paying
customers. I also get another $80 in profit per customer from supplement
sales. Not too shabby .”
“Agreed,” he grunted. “So you make like 680 bucks per customer before
you even open your doors. Pretty dang good…but you left something out.”
“What did I leave out?”
“How much you payin’  per lead?”
“Oh…$5.” If a deafening silence ever happened in my life—this was it.
He stuttered a bit, “So you put one dollar in…and get 34 dolla rs out… in
48 hours?”
“Yeah? Is that good?”
“It’s amazing,” he said. “Do you have anything happening on the back
end?”
I grinned ear-to-ear . “Yea! A few weeks later, I tell them they can get
their $600 back as credit if they choose to sign up for a year. Two-thirds of
sign-ups convert into memberships.  So I end up with a full gym and
$20,000 of monthly memberships…for $3,000 down. Then I rinse and
repeat.”
“Wait a second, you do all this in thirty days ?”
“Yep. Pretty cool right?”
He rubbed his eyes. “Y ou shouldn’ t be running gyms.”
Oh god. I thought he was going to compliment me—but he told me I
should quit? My mind raced…
“Alex,” he said, snapping me back to reality , “you have a level-10 skill in
a level-2 opportunity .”
Well, at least he doesn’ t think I suck. “Ok, what should I do?”
“You shouldn’ t be running gyms. You should be showing other gym
owners how to do what you just showed me.”

I hated the idea of giving up on what I took years to build. But… he made
a lot more mone y than I did. I figured, if I ignored his advice, I may as well
burn my money . So, I took his advice.
***
Over the next nine months, I closed down my newest gym and sold my
other five. That gave me the time to go all in on my new company: Gym
Launch. Over the next two years, I flew around the country turning gyms
around. Then, after 30+ turnarounds, I switched to a licensing model. I no
longer flew out in person. Instead, I helped them follow our proven model
to fill their gyms and increase profits. A small market to be sure, but they
were starving —some literally . But once they filled their gym in thirty days,
they told their friends. Gym Launch took of f like a rocket. It was wild.
Over the next five years I took over $43,000,000 in owner distributions.
Then, I sold 66% of the compa ny at $46,200,000 in an all-cash  deal. With
that deal, I crossed a $100M net worth at age 31. And to be clear , no one
was more surprised than me.
From there, my wife and I founded our family office Acquisition.com to
invest in businesses we know how to grow . Our portfolio at the time of this
writing does over $200,000,000 per year in annual revenue. It spans brick &
mortar chains, software, service s, and ecommerce. Even though we work in
many different industries, our companies all grow using the same principles
I share in this book.

So What’s In It For You?
In a few pages, I took you from sleeping on the floor to crossing
$100,000,000 in net worth. So the natural question is…how? Answer: by
making more money from customers than it costs to get them . And that’s
what this book $100M Money Models  is all about.
Since I’ve been in business, the landscape has changed more than once.
And it’ll keep changing. The good news is, sound principles help you print
money no matter what. I’ve learned a lot of Money Models. I cover my
favorites here.
$100M Money Models  shows already proven  offers you can use today .
And, the instructions to make them happen. Think of $100M Money Models
as a book of winning lottery tickets—all you have to do is cash them in.
Also, I want to make something clear , these are my private notes. If it’s
here, I’ve made money with it. These chapters contain my observations and
experiences with different businesses. From local chains, to physical
products, to services, educatio n, software, and so on. And they were
scattered everywhere over the years. Until now .
This is my cookbook for making money .

How This Book Is Structured
This book teaches you one insanel y profitable thing: how to build a
$100M Money Model.  With a $100M Money Model, you make so much
money in the first thirty days that the cost of getting more customers will
never be a problem again . With so many customers, you’ll be forced to
work on everything else in your business to just keep up! A problem for
another book to solve (winky face).
