Extra! Extra! Hear All About It!
The point of Attraction Offers is to turn strangers into customers. And, to
do it in a way that gets more cash up front. Ideally , we get enough cash to
cover the cost of the customer and the cost to deliver our thing multiple
times over . That way we can pay ourselves back and get our next customer .
I showed you the five most powerful Attraction Offers I’ve seen and used:
Win Your Mone y Back, Giveaways, Decoy Offers, Buy X Get Y Free, and
Pay Less Now or Pay More Later . I apply them at one time or another to
every business I own. They turned $1,000 into $10,000,000 in ten months
because when I got returns I kept doubling down. A Grand Slam Attraction
Offer changes your business (and life) forever.
After using Attraction Offers, we’ve got more customers. And now that
we got ‘em, we need to boost our 30-day profits  by sellin g them more stuff.
This leads us to the next component of a $100M  Money Model —Upsell
Offers: What to offer next.

SECTION III: UPSELL
OFFERS
Do you want fries with that? - McDonald’ s Famous Upsell
With an Attracti on Offer in place, you’ve got customers and cash. If we
did a good job, we’ve turned a profit too. Nice! Now we want to maximize
30-day profits. So what do we do? Answer: make more money . To do that,
we make Upsell  Offers. And when it comes down to it, Upsells just mean
whatever we offer next.

How Upsells Work
When an offer solves a problem, another appears. You upsell  the solution
to the problem your offer reveals. So, every offer opens the door to an
upsell…even upsells! Often, upsells make the majority of the profit. They
make or break a Money Model. Let me show you how much.
Let’s say a burger shop makes $0.25 in profit on a $2.00 burger. If it was
the only offer they had, they’d have to sell ~10,000 burgers a day to cover
costs and barely eek out a “living.” Good luck. But, they have more offers
beyond just the burger. They ask “Do you want fries with that?”  If they say
yes, they profit another $0.75 and ask “Do you want to make it a meal?”
which adds a drink. If someone says yes, they profit an extra  $1.75. Their
profit goes from $0.25 to $2.00— an 8x increase. And on top of that, they
offer a third upsell “Do you want to supersize your meal for just a buck
more?” This takes profit from measly $0.25 to a massive $3.00— a 11.6x
increase. And now this little burger place actually has a chance at
succeeding.

I show this basic (and common !) example to point out one thing—your
first offer doesn’ t always  make the profit. In other words, the thing you sell
the most isn’t always the thing you make the most profit on. You make it on
the second, third, and in the case of the burger business, fourth  offers and
beyond. If McDonald’ s didn’ t upsell fries and soda, there wouldn’ t be a
McDonald’ s. If you want to win, you have to figure out your version of
“Do you want fries with that?”  If you don’ t, others will.
Upsells fail when:
You offer something they don’t want (too different or doesn’t solve
their problem).
You offer it at the wrong time (before they’ve experienced the
problem).
You offer it the wrong way (they don’t believe you).
Or, a combination of the above.
In summary , Upsells tend to of fer:
More of what they just got (think quantity)—Why have one burger
when you can have two?
Better versions of it (think quality)—Why have mystery meat when
you can have sirloin?

New or complementary stuff (think different)—Do you want fries
and a soda with that burger?
