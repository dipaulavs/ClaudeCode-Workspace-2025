Payment Plan Downsells (how they pay)

Trial With Penalty (how they pay)
Feature Downsells (what they get)
These downsell processes boost 30-day profit even further . They do it by
making even more sales when customers would have said no. And I love
them because with just a couple tweaks, you can fit them into your business
and reap the rewards today .

Payment Plan Downsells
How much can you put down today?
August 2013.
It was my first real month in business. I had exactly one month’ s rent in
savings left to my name…and I had never gotten a stranger to give me
money . And now, I had to get dozens of strangers to give me money in the
next few weeks—just to keep the lights on.
I only made a few sales the first week. If I kept that up, it meant going
hungry very soon. I had nightm ares about going back home a failure. The
idea was unbearable. I got desperate.
The next mornin g a lead walked in and I went through my normal pitch.
She said “I can’t afford it.” Normally , I’d just give up. But, I really  needed
the money . So in my desperation I blurted out “OK, when do you get paid?”
“The first.”
“Okay , just put half down now , and half when you get paid.”
“I can’ t afford that either .”
“Okay—do you really wanna do this program?”
“Yeah, I do.”
“What if you do three payments and just put a third down today?”

“I still can’ t do it.”
“Hmm… What can you do?
“Honestly , nothing. But I can pay for the whole thing on the first.”
My rent was due on the fifth. Bingo . “Sounds good. Just give me your
card and I’ll char ge it on the second. That work?”
“Yea—great!”
Two weeks later. I ran the card. And it worked.  My first ever payment plan
—a success. Hallelujah.

Payment Plan Downsells work no matter how many zeroes the price tag
has. I’ve made tens of millions of dollars with them and I still use them to
this day. But, payment plans are a gamble. So you have to know how to use
them. I know how to use them and I’ll show you exactly how .
Payment plans are a gamble because they can make money in one way,
but they can lose money in two. They make you more money when you get
more customers and those customers complete their payments.  They make
you less money when people cancel before you turn a profit. You lose the
most when peop le who would have paid in full take a payment plan—and
cancel early .
This chapter maximizes how much money you make from paym ent plans
and minimizes the money you lose. I take the bet when I know I’ll win.
With this playbook, you can too.
Description
When most peop le think “downsell,” they think of a lower amount, lower
quality , cheaper , and so on. Fair enough. But I like to downsell by offering
the same product again. I know it sounds crazy , but hear me out. Instead of
offering a different thing, I spread the cost by charging some of it up front
and putting the rest into scheduled payments. I call this a Payment Plan
Downsell. Let’ s go over how they work.
Many people reject offers because they “cost too much.” Sometimes true.
But in response  to this, busines s owners and other sales professionals will
immediately discount or sell cheaper stuff just to get people to say yes.
However , a huge  percent age of the time “it costs too much” really means

“this costs too much up front.” In other words, people think discounts work
because people pay less for the product. But when you peel it back a layer ,
it’s really because they pay less in the moment.  So Payment Plans get the
best of both worlds. They get more buyers because customers pay less in
the moment. But they also boost your profits because customers still pay
full price over time.
My Payment Plan Downsell process takes up to seven steps. The process
shifts from getting paid more up front to more over time. I stop when they
buy. Here are the steps:
1. Reward for paying in full rather than punish for paying over time
2. Offer 3rd-party financing, credit card, layaway options
3. Offer half now, half later
4. Check to see if they still want the thing
5. Offer to split into three payments
6. Offer evenly spread payments
7. Offer a Free Trial
Let’s go through them in order .
Example Of Payment Plan Downsell Process
Step 1) Reward  For Paying In Full Rather  Than Punish For Paying
Over  Time. If I take on the risk of a payment plan, I increase the price.
Normal busines ses do it by charging interest. But, I do it by offering a
discount  if they pay in full .
Think about how businesses normally charge interest—they basically
say…“ It’s $10 if you get it right now, but it’s $15 if you pay over time
because we char ge $5 in inter est.”  No fun.
Instead, I say “It’s $15…but it’s $10 if you prepay it. You save $5…that’ s
what most people do.” To do this, I present the price with interest included .
Then, I offer prepayment as a way to get a discount. This way, we make the
offer friendlier and benefit from a price anchor . Same math, but feels better .
If they say no, I start downselling. But, even still. I try to get paid first…
Step 2) Offer  3rd-Party Financing, Credit Card, and Layaway
Options.

3rd-Party Financ ing: This means another company pays me now and the
customer has a payment plan with that other comp any. Car dealers do this
all the time. The dealer gets money from the financing company today , and
the customer pays the financing company tomorrow .
Note : It takes work to get 3rd-party  financing set up. But, totally worth
the ef fort.
Credit Card: Just ask “would  you rather I decide your payment terms or
you decide?” They say they’d prefer to decide. When they do, I tell them to
use a credit card. That way I get paid today and they can pay the credit card
company over time. It’s wild to me that this reframe works. But, it does. I
don’t judge, I do.
Layaway:  Layaway means paying off the product befor e getting it.
Customers can make as many installments as they want. They can take any
reasonable amount of time to pay. But, they only get the product after
they’ve paid in full. This is by far the most flexibl e for them and lowest risk
for us.
If they say no to these, I move to step 3.
Step 3) Offer  ‘Half Now , Half Later .’ I start by asking  “When’ s the next
time you get paid?”  After , I ask “Wanna just put half down today and the
rest down when you get paid?”  If they can’t do that, I ask “What’ s the most
you can put down today?” When they offer an amount say, “Great. We’ll
put that down today and put the rest when you get paid. Fair enough?” I
like scheduling payments off of paychecks since most people get paid every
two weeks. This boosts 30-day profit way more than monthly payments.
If they can’ t do those...I pause to make sure they actually want it.
Step 4) Check To See If They Still Want The Thing. No payment plan
will satisfy a customer who doesn’ t want the thing. So, make sure the
person actually wants your thing before putting more effort into selling it. I
might say something like “Got it. So money is tight right now. Real quick. I
want to make sure. On a scale from 1–10 how bad do you wanna do this?”
If they say 8 or above, keep offering payment plans and say “Awesome.
Don’ t worry . We’re gonna figur e out a way to make this happen for you.”  If
they say 7 or below , ask “Why not a 10?” and then, say something like
“You’re right. I think we may have something that could be a better fit for
you.” Then you sell them something different (Feature Downsells—a  little
later).

Step 5) Offer  To Split Into Three Payments. If they said 8–10 on the
scale, I downsell from half down to a third down. I offer a three-payment
option: ⅓  now and ⅓  on the next two paychecks—or— ⅓  now and ⅓  the
next two months.
Step 6) Offer  Evenly Spread Payments. If they still can’t manage it, I
evenly spread payments over the rest of their service. For instance, Gym
Launch was sixteen weeks long, so I charged them each week (sixteen
times in total). If that still creates problems, I move to step 7.
Step 7) Offer  A Free Trial. I offer Free Trials in a special way. So, I
dedicated the next chapter to it. But, the sale ends here. At least for now .
This Payment Plan Downsell process makes up to nine offers. And if you
think that sounds crazy , you’re probably making way less money and
serving way fewer customers than you could.
Important Notes
“Seesaw” Downselling . If you prefer fewer steps , or have less
experienced salespeople, then you can use this payment plan downsell
process. Instead  of asking for the full amount, just ask “Would you rather
have giant mont hly payments or tiny ones?” They’ll say tiny. Then you say
“It normally costs XXX. And if you prepay it today , you get a huge discount
and zero monthly payments. That work?”  This frames the payment plan as
negative and highlights the benefits of prepaying.
Then, if they say they can’t afford it, say the more they put down now, the
lower their monthly payments. “If you can’t affor d it up front, I totally get
it. We’ll simply adjust the down  payment until you get a monthly rate you
like.”  This still incentivizes bigger down payments to get their monthly
payments lower . If they still say no, ask if they still want the product. If
they do, pull your chair to their side of the table and walk them  through the
options. The sale becomes a team ef fort. Straightforward.
Payment Plans  Have Built-In Upsells : Make periodic offers for the
original paid-in-full-discount during their payment plan. If they pay off the
balance, they can still get the original ‘prepay discount.’  This works
exceptionally well. Customers forget they have the option. So when we give
it to them, some jump at the opportunity . Also, give your sales guys the
same bonus to close the balance to incentivize follow up. And remember , if

you give people the option to pay slower , they will pay slower. If you
incentivize them  to pay faster , they will pay faster . So if you want them to
pay faster , give them a good reason to.
Get Fewer  Declined Payments. Align payment schedules with paycheck
schedules. If you charge on days people get paid, they have a higher chance
of paying. Also, people’ s payche cks get deposited at different times, so if at
first it gets declined, run it a few times that day. I learned this strategy from
John (my early mentor). I often recoup a third of my declined payments by
adding this little process.
How To Make Sure Paym ent Plans Make You Money . After
implementing payment plans, your close rate should increase. Duh. But, if
the number of paid-in-fulls goes down, you have a problem. You’ve just put
people who would’ve paid in full on payment plans! So, you want to close
more appointments overall but with the same percentage of appointments
paying in full.
Ex: If I talk to ten leads, I might sell three. If I have a downsell, I might
sell three more (for a total of six). So, in the second scenario, I get my up
front cash from the first three and the payments from the second three. This
makes sure downsells properly increase your 30-day profits.
Another  Reaso n To Start High Befor e Working Your Way Down.
Profitwell (a company that manages subscriptions) reported churn data from
14,000 businesses. They uncovered this valuable gem. Across all
businesses , the billing cadence af fected monthly churn.
Monthly  (12x per year) billing resulted  in 10.7% monthly cancellation
rates.
Quarterly  (4x per year) billing resulted in 5% monthly cancellation rates.
Annual  (1x per year) billing resulted in 2% monthly cancellations.
I already present pricing in order of most cash up front to least. It just so
happens this also makes customers more valuable over the long term. So
start high (fewer bigger payments) and work your way down.
Bottom Line:  Changing how customers pay can have a massive
difference in how long they stay. We go in more depth on continuity and
churn in Section V: Continuity Of fers.

Summary Points
Payment Plan Downsells spread the cost of a product by charging
some of it up front and putting the rest into scheduled payments.
Payment Plans get more buyers like discounts, but can also boost
profits because they agree to pay the full price over time.
Payment Plans only grow your business if they get more customers
and those customers actually pay.
Step 1) Present at full price then offer a discount if they pay in full.
Step 2) 3rd-party financing, then credit card option, then layaway
option.
Step 3) Split the payment in two. Schedule on their paycheck dates.
Step 4) Ask if they still want the product on a scale of 1–10. You
want 8 or greater.
Step 5) Split the payment in three. Schedule on their paycheck
dates or monthly.
Step 6) Schedule equal payments across a specified amount of
time.
Step 7) Offer a Free Trial in exchange for putting a card down.
Covered in the next chapter.
“Seesaw” Downselling gradually shifts from paid-in-full to equal
payments.
Payment plan upsell: they get the original discount price if they pay
the balance today.
Align payment schedules with paycheck schedules to get fewer
declined payments.
At the end of all this, if someone still refuses  to pay anything, then we
offer them a Free Trial in excha nge for their card. But it’s not an ordinary
Free Trial. I do it in a special way. It took me years to perfect it. So that’s
where we go next. You’re gonna love it .

Properly designed payment plans almost always make  you
more sales and more money . I recorded myself actually doing
the step downs so you can model them for whatever you sell.
