Continuity Bonus Offers
If you like this, you’r e gonna love what I have next…
Fall 2019. When I learned that bonuses got more people to join continuity
programs…
I taught gym owners how to sell six-week challenges and they were
making money hand over fist. But some of them weren’ t that good at
converting people into continu ity after the challenge. Then, out of the
blue…I saw a gym that used to struggle posting numbers way higher  than
some of our best performers.
Naturally , I investigated…
“Dude—your numbers are insane. How do you convert so many
members?” I asked.
“I’m not really doing the six-week challenge,” he said.
“Wait. What do you mean? You’re marketing the six-week challenge
though, right?”
“Yep. But I of fer them something else when they come in.”
“Okay…help me understand.”
“So we go throu gh the normal pitch. We explain the price. Yada yada. As
soon as they say they’re interested, we ask if they want to get it for free.
They of course say yes. Then, I tell them that if they become  a member ,

we’ll make it free, which they love. And on top of that, if they become
members, they also get member -exclusive bonuses. Members get better
class times, the tanning booth, VIP events, all sorts of cool stuff. It converts
like crazy . Last, we upsell a discounted prepaid membership.”
“How does that go?” I asked.
“Well, for anyone who joins, we immediately ask ‘wanna save even more
money?’  They lean in. Then we offer a prepaid discount and bonuses for six
months of membership.”
“This is awesome. Does anyone even take the original challenge offer
anymore?”
“Some do, sure. Can’ t be mad at more up front cash.”
“I dig it. Break down some of your numbers, would you?”
“Before, we’d get thirty-four out of a hundred to sign up for the challenge.
Then, a few weeks later we’d convert half (seventeen ) to stay. Now , we only
get like fifteen to sign up for the challenge but we get forty  to go straight
into continuity . And of those forty, about eight of them take the six month
prepayment upsell.”
“So let me get this straight…you tripled  membership sales…you still get
up front  cash from challenges… and you stack even  more up front cash
from prepaid memberships??”
He could barely contain his grin. And for good reason. His tiny tweak was
genius.
Description
With Continuity  Bonuses you give the customer an awesome thing if they
sign up today . Typically , the bonus itself has more value than the first
continuity payment. That’ s all there is to it.
Bonus—adding value. For products, you can give away many small things
or one big product that complements the subscription. For services, you
give away a defined program, onboarding, setup, or feature that adds value.
Discount—lowering costs. Remember , anything you offer for free you can
also offer as a discount. Free stuff and discounts both affect how we make
decisions. So, we want to do both to get the benefits of both.
When making Continuity Offers, I get more people to start if I add more
good stuff (bonu ses) and take away bad stuff (discounts). And of course, it

all works better with a dash of urgency —if they join now. Also, you can
offer the bonus as a standalone purchase, or you can only make it availabl e
if they buy your continuity . Either works.
On their own, Continuity Offers get less cash now, and that makes it tough
for getting customers profitably . But the way I use them, we can still hit our
30-day profit goals. Here’ s how:  First, I do all my big-cash Attraction,
Upsell, and Downsell offers. Then, Continuity Offers get a little bit of cash
from the first month’ s payments. Then, I offer people who bought one
month a discount on prepaying more months. This further boosts 30-day
profits, giving me more cash to advertise, and stacks recurring revenue. Not
too shabby .
Author  Note: No successful continuity businesses I’ve seen has
a standalone membership offer. They all have other bells and
whistles to upsell. Main reason: Continuity Offers are tough to
advertise profitably . Nobody wants to make a recurring
commitment to something they haven’t tried. To make up for
this, businesses attract customers with stuff like trials. Then,
once people join, they upsell other features and longer-term
prepay options. This gets them the cash they need to advertise
while  building their recurring revenue.

Important Notes
Focus On The Bonus, Not The Membership. “Join my memb ership
program” isn’t nearly as compe lling as “get this free valuable  thing.” So
advertise that. Then, explain the rest after they show interest.
Bonuses Work Kinda Like Upsells.
More of the same: You get two years of past newsl etters free by becoming
a member .
Complementary : You get nutriti on services for free when you sign up for
our fitness membership.
Upgrade: You get a free gold membership when you buy a bronze
membership (limited availability).
Keep Your Bonuses Related To Your Core Offer . If the bonus is too
different you will attract the wrong customers.  For instance, don’t advertise
a free t-shirt to upsell tech services. But, advertising a free t-shirt to upsell t-
shirt printing makes sense.
Make Bonuses Things You Already  Have And Do. For instance, the two
past years of newsletters cost no extra time but are super high value. And
onboarding is something you have to do with the client anyways, so you
might as well slap a price on it and give to ‘em as a bonus. If you value it,
they will too.
Physical Bonuses on Digital Products and Digital Bonuses with
Physical Products. If I have a digital membership, I might offer a hat, shirt,
or tool, etc. related to the offer. If I have a physical product or service, like a
boxing gym membership, offering live stream classes can get more people
to sign up. This strategy often lowers the cost of getting a customer more

than the cost of the bonus. And that’s the point. Also, if some people take
the bonus and run, the lower advertising costs can still make up for it. If
customers are too expensive, give it a try .
Use Realistic Bonus Pricing. The bigger the value-anchor on your bonus,
the more compelling the offer. But, you also have to make that anchor
believable. Some business owners make up ridiculous values. Don’ t do this.
It won’ t anchor the customer and you’ll lose trust with them. This is a great
opportunity to give away products you’ve sold before. You can anchor their
actual prices as real discounts and bonuses.
You Can Bonus Your Custom ers By Giving Them Titles.  Consid er
giving customer s titles after they stay three, six, or twelve months and
beyond. Titles like silver , gold, diamond, double diamond, etc. A good
friend of mine does this, and after a while, she found her customers cared
more about the title than any other bonus. She told me they even introduced
themselves to her by their title! So, if you can’t think of somet hing to give
them, at the very least, you can call them something special.
You Can Make Free Bonuse s Discounts and Make Discounts Free
Bonuses.
Free Bonus: Become a member for $200 then you get this $1,000 program
as a free bonus ! Steep Discount: Get the $1,000 program for $1 if you
become a member for $200.
When Making Your Continuit y Offer , Anchor  The Bonuses. First, sell
them the benefits of the amazi ng bonus. Not your Continuity Offer—the
bonus. Then, use your high-va lue bonus as an anchor . It may shock them—
and that’s okay. Becaus e then you ask, “Do you want to know how you can
get this for free? ” If they do, which they will, explain how: “Become a VIP
member today and you’ll get it all as a free gift for joining. Or, you can just
buy it for $XXX—which would you pr efer?”
More Bonuses Get More People To Join. After you ask them if they
want to know how to get it for free, you tell them they can get it when they
join. Then you say “on top of that... when you beco me a member you’ll
get…amazing thing 1, amazing thing 2, amazing thing 3.” Mention the
individual dolla r values of each  to anchor the value.  Stacking bonuses this
way gets even more people to join your continuity .
Making Bonus es Available Only To Those Who Join. If you want to
force everyone into continuity , then offer continuity as the only option. In

other words, make the bonuses only available  if they join the membership.
Pricing For Continuity vs. Up Front Cash. For whatever reason, some
people pick one-time payments over continuity… even with higher one-time
payments.  So offer a higher one-time payment option. This way some
customers will make you more money today  while others stack recurring
revenue for tomorr ow. We change the price depending on our goals. I’ve
tested this a ton and, at least for me, the data in this range look clear . Check
it out:
To get 50% to choose continuity make the standalone of fer 1.33x more.
Ex: $399 standalone ($266/mo) or $199/mo membership
To get 60% to choose continuity make the standalone of fer 1.66x more.
Ex: $499 standalone ($333/mo) or $199/mo membership
To get 70% to choose continuity make the standalone of fer 2x more.
Ex: $599 standalone ($399/mo) or $199/mo membership
To get 80% to choose continuity make the standalone of fer 2.33x more.
Ex: $699 standalone ($466/mo) or $199/mo membership
To get 90% to choose continuity make the standalone of fer 2.66x more.
Ex: $799 standalone ($532/mo) or $199/mo membership

The exact numbers matter less than the principle. The smaller the
standalone price  compar ed to the continuity price, the more people buy the
standalone. The larger the standalone price compar ed to the continuity
price, the mor e people choose continuity .
If You Want More Up Front Cash.  Make bonuses and
continuity+bonuses separate  offers. Make the bonus-only offer a single
payment that’s 1.33x to 2.66x more expensive than the first month of the
continuity+bonus offer. The bigger the price difference, the fewer
standalone purch ases you’ll have. But, the more money you make up front
from each. Base d on the data I just shared, people pay 33% more to avoid
continuity . In other words, even if you charge 33% more for a one-time
purchase, half will buy it!
If You Want Even More Cash—Offer  Bulk Prepaid Discounts. Bulk
continuity upsel ls boost 30-day profits by a lot. Let’s say you offer “buy
five months get one free.” Only one out of every eight people  has to take the
upsell to raise 30-day profits by 50%! That can make or break your Money
Model. Note : The laws of discounting apply—the larger the discount, the
more people will take it.
If You Want Commitments—Pr epar e To Make A Trade.  If you want
commitments, trade them for bonuses. For example, only allow customers
to get the bonus if they commit to 3-6-12+ months. When you only give it
to customers who commit, you’ll lose people who would’ve signed up
month-to-month just to get the bonus. This nets fewer sales , but more
committed customers. This is the trade you make.
Summary Points
When it comes down to it, offering real discounts and then following up
with valuable free bonuses makes people excited about your offer. Then, if
they agree to your continuity offer, you can further upsell block s of time to
boost your 30-day profits even more.
With Continuity Bonuses you give the customer an awesome
thing if they sign up today. Typically, the bonus itself has more
value than the first continuity payment.

If you use Continuity as an attraction offer, advertise what you
give away, not what you sell.
Make your bonus related to your core offer so you engage the
right leads.
If possible, make your bonuses stuff you already have and do.
This way, you don’t need to change your business or create new
products.
More people start continuity if you add more bonuses and
discounts.
To add bonuses—add more good stuff only if they sign up.
To discount—take away the cost of actual products, services, and
features you sell.
Sell the value of the bonus before telling them how they can get it
for free.
Offer bonuses as a standalone option for more up front cash.
If you want half the people to take the standalone offer, price it
33% above your continuity.
Boost up front cash even more by offering continuity at a
discount if they buy in bulk.
