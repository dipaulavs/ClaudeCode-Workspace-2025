Pro Tip: Faster , Deeper  Learning By Reading & Listening At The
Same Time
Here’ s a life hack I stumbled on a few years ago. If you listen to
an audiobook and read the physical book or ebook at the same
time, you read faster and remember more. You store the
contents in more places in your brain. Nifty stuff. This is how I
read books worth reading.
I also do both because I struggle to stay focused. If I listen to
the audio while reading it helps me avoid zoning out. It took me
two days to record this book out loud. I did it so if you struggle
like me, you don’t have to anymore.
If you want to give it a try, go ahead and grab the audio version
and see for yourself. I’ve made my books as cheap as the
platforms let me, so this isn’t a ploy to make some extra coin—I
promise. I hope you find it as valuable as I have.
I figured I’d put this “hack” early on. This way you’d have a
chance to do it if you found the first chapter valuable enough to
earn your attention.
Pro Tip: Hack For  Finishing Books
I get distracte d easily . So I need little tricks to keep my
attention. This one helps me alot: Finish chapters. Don’t stop in
the middle . Completing a chapter gives you positive
reinforcement. It keeps you going. So, if you meet a tough
chapter , finish it so you can start fresh on the next one.

SECTION I: WHA T’S A
MONEY  MODEL?
“Hormozi has the highest return  on advertising of any business using our
advertising tracking platform...by a mile. He has the biggest discr epancy
we’ve seen between dollars spent and dollars earned. And we only work
with businesses spending at least $250,000 per year on marketing or more,
so these are the cream of the crop marketers and his numbers are in the
stratospher e by comparison.” - Alex Becker , CEO, Hyr os.com
December 2019.
“Hello sir, can I have your ID so I can look up your reservation ?” the car
rental agent said, smiling. I already had my ID ready and slid it across the

counter .
“Hmm. It looks like we don’t have the car you reserved. We have an
equivalent car though… but you’re a big guy. Would you prefer a roomier
pick-up truck instead?”
“Yea, that sounds nice,” I said.
“I’ve got you down here for three days.” She cocked her head to the side a
bit. “Would you like to have a late return so you can turn in the vehicle at
any time during the day without worrying about late fees?”
I pulled up my schedule on my phone. “Yeah, we have an evening flight.
So that sounds good.”
“Great. Give me a second…just  putting that in. So would you like better
insurance to cover any bumps or scratches on the car? It covers any and all
damage to the vehicle during your time.”
“Nope I’m good. No plans on drag racing while we’re here,” I joked.
“So only the minimum  insurance then?”
“Yep. That’ s all I’ll need.”
“Okay then, I’ll have your keys in a second. Did you want us to take care
of fuel so you don’t have to worry about filling it up? You can return it on
empty and not worry about paying a fee. We do it for $3.75/gallon.”
“What’ s the gas around here?” I asked.
“About $3.50/gallon,” she replied cheerfully .
“Sure, why not. I hate filling it up when I’m rushing to catch a flight.”
“Alrighty then! Here’ s your receipt. Just go around the corner and your
truck should be about halfway down on the left. Enjoy your trip!”
***
As I walked away , I glanced at the receipt and it stopped me in my tracks.
I could only laugh at myself. I came for a $19/day car and I left paying
$100/day . A 5x difference! And that’s the power of a well designed Money
Model. They knew everything I wanted (and things I didn’ t even know I
would want). And when they of fered them to me, I happily bought them.

A Money Model Happened
A Money Model is a sequence of offers . At their core, we find every
opportunity to solve a customer ’s problem…and then offer to solve it. For
that reason, Money Models tend to have many offers in a speci fic order . If
you offer the right thing when customers realize they need it, you can make
as many offers as you like .
This is the rental car company’ s Money Model stated plainly:
Offer #1  Vehicle Upgrade
Offer #2  Late Return
Offer #3  Premium Insurance
Offer #4  Minimum Insurance Downsell
Offer #5  Prepaid Gas
So yeah, I paid more, but it also solve d more problems. Let’s break down
the problems she solved:
She solved my ‘big man in a small car’ problem by offering a vehicle
that had more space.
She solved my ‘late checkout’ problem by offering the flexibility to
keep the vehicle longer.
She solved my ‘worries about dinging the car’ by offering insurance
to protect against it.
She solved my ‘risk of missing my flight’ problem by offering a way
to prepay for the gas ahead of time so I wouldn’t have to do it on my
ride back.
…And all those things cost money I was happy to pay .
The rental car company thought out every nuance. They told me about the
problem, then made their solution available to me. They offered solutions

for higher fees and hassles I might have had later for smaller fees in total
right  now.
As a result, my $19 rental became a $100 rental. I paid more money faster.
And now, we can see why the car rental industry brings in billions in the
United States alone… per month . A successful Money Model.
Beware: Bad Money Models Kill Businesses
It costs many businesses more to get somebody to buy a thing  than they
make in profit off the thing. In other words, they lose money getting new
customers— that’s a big pr oblem.
And here’ s what happens…
They spend money to get customers.
At the end of the month, they realize they spent more than they
made.
They cut back on advertising.
Get fewer customers than they can handle because they can’t
afford them.
Then, cut advertising altogether.
Float the business with personal cash, loans, credit, and then…
pray for profit.
Sell percentages of their business just to keep the lights on.
Wait months (or years!) to make their money back…if ever.
Fall further and further behind until…
Finally, they lose it all.
But it doesn’ t have to be that way. There’ s plenty of money . You just have
to go get it .
In traditional business, the slow  drip of profits from lots of customers
eventually  pays for a single  customer . This ‘drip’  starves the business of
cash. It means they can only get lots of customers through advertising… if
they already have lots of custo mers!  Big companies  (or small comp anies
with investors) can do this because they have the money to burn.

Think about it this way. If you spend $100 in advertising to get a customer
and make $500 in profit from them, that’s a great deal. You should take it
all day. But what if it takes you two years to make your cash back? It’s a
great business… if you already have tons of cash in the bank . Otherwise,
you’r e gonna run out of money . That leaves you with two options:
Option #1: Wait two years to get paid and pray you don’t run out of
money .
Option #2: Get paid fast and grow as much as you darn well please.
A good Money Model is option 2 .
Author  Note: Make Enough Profit To Cover  Your Costs In 30
Days Or  Less
I like to cover my costs of getting a customer within 30 days.
Main reason: any business can get interest-free money for 30
days in the form of a credit card. If you clear your balance
before the end of the month, it works just like normal money . So
you can use credit to get a customer , pay it back, and then use
it again to get the next customer . And if you can pay it off befor e
the 30 days, you can go do it again. Rinse and repeat.
Good Money Models Make Millionaires
If you make more offers, and people buy them, you make more  money . If
you make more money , you can use it to get more customers. If they pay
you that money faster , the faster you can get those customers and stay
profitable .
But what if you make your customers twice as valuable, you get twice as
many of them, and get those customers at twice the speed?… your business
grows 8x faster . And if you triple them… your business grows 27x faster .
See where I’m going with this? You can get really big, really profitable,
really fast… with just a few changes . And that’s exactly what I’m gonna
show you how to do.

Next Up
Money Models are a sequence of offers. Different offers solve different
problems. So if you want to win, you have to figure out what to offer next.
To figure that out, you’ve gotta understand The Four Offer T ypes…

The Four Types of Offers That Make Money
Models
Stop being poor . - Paris Hilton
The limit does not exist. - Lindsay Lohan, Cady Her on in Mean Girls
Making one offer works bette r than making none. And making more
offers works better than making one. Combining offers in a sequence makes
a Money Model. My Money Models combine four dif ferent of fer types.
Four Types of Offers
There are four types of offers: Attraction Offers, Upsell Offers, Downsell
Offers, and Continuity Offers. All improve our Money Model, but they all
do it differ ently . They work great on their own, but together they make your
business unstoppable.
1. Attraction Offers turn strangers into customers.
2. Upsell Offers get people to spend more cash.
3. Downsell Offers get people to say yes when they would have said
no.
4. Continuity Offers keep people buying.
If you look at great businesses, you’ll see different versions of these offers
as core components of their money-making engine. You can use one, two,
multiples of one, or all four together . You can combine them however you

want. But, when I look at my most profitable businesses, I used all four.
And here’ s why:
If you don’t have an offer for getting customers, you won’ t get as many .
But let’s say you do. If you only have that one thing to offer, you won’ t
make nearly as much money as you could. So if you have something to
offer next, an upsell, you’ll finally get some cash. But, you still won’ t make
as much as you could because lots of people will still say “no.” So, we turn
those “nos” into “yeses” with downsells. And that works fine. But it would
be even better if you had that extra cash guaranteed  to come  in month after
month . So, you make a continuity offer to top it off. That’ s how I like to do
it.
How I Structured The Sections
I start with Attra ction Offers, because if you’re not getting custo mers, you
need one of those first. Then , we cover Upsell Offers, followed by
Downsell Offers. Then to finish the four types, I show you my favorite
Continuity Of fers exactly how I learned them .
How I Structured Each Chapter
Each chapter has six elements:
1. Doodle directly from my notes. Exactly as I drew it. It helped me
remember it, so it will help you remember it, too.
2. The story of how I first learned this Money Model.
3. A description of how the Money Model works.
4. A few examples of how this Money Model works in different
industries. Think of how you could use the Money Model in your
business.
5. Important notes and tactics that make the Money Model work.
These tidbits help you execute the play—like it’s your hundredth
time doing it—on your first try.
6. A summary. All the important points about the Money Model.
Plus, some extra thoughts sprinkled in about how to make the

Money Model more profitable.
Important Notes:
Alright. Before I release this pile of gold nuggets I need to make a few
things clear:
1. All Businesses Have Money Models. It Makes A Business A
Business. Switch the poor person mantra “this won’t work for
my business” to the rich person mantra “how will I make this
work for my business?” They all work. Be creative.
2. Some Money Models Work Better In Some Businesses Than
Others. They’re just different ways to offer stuff. If you just try
to copy what “they” do you’ll be disappointed. To make it work
for your business, you have to design your own (but don’t worry,
I’ll show you how).
3. If A Customer Asks For Their Money Back—Give It Back.
Avoid the headache. And if you made a goof—fix the goof. Don’t
be a silly goose. Treat customers well. Next time, spend the time
and resources to get better customers.
4. Hard Selling Is For Weak Products. If someone doesn’t want
something, that’s OK. Don’t convince someone against their will.
Make offers available at the time your customer has a problem
and you’ll be ahead of the competition. If they don’t want it, no
sweat. Find somebody who does. It’s a numbers game.
5. Obey The Law. I learned these plays in different situations from
different people using different platforms, in different times, in
different places, following different rules. Advertising laws
change all the time. And they tend to only get tighter—especially
when it comes to “free.” Check with lawyers to see if an offer
you want to make is legal or not. This book is intended to be
Money Model inspiration. Use it that way.
6. Be Transparent. State the facts. And if the facts aren’t
compelling, change reality to make them compelling or learn to
frame them in a way that is. Don’t lie. You’ll short-change

yourself long-term. And unlike credit card debt, you can’t file
bankruptcy to erase a bad reputation. Once you have a bad one, it
sticks for life.
7. Any Offer Can Be Used On Its Own, At Any Time, in Any
Order. A business works as long as it makes a profit. Most offers
in this book could meet that minimum requirement on their own.
When used in the right sequence, and at the right time, they make
a $100M Money Model. I’ve got big dreams, and I bet you do too.
So, we’re gonna use ‘em all.
With that said, let’ s go for a ride.
First Up: Attraction Offers
Most businesses spend too much to get customers and make too little from
them. They are cash-c onstrained.  But, you use cash to get more customers.
And I like more  customers. So I always solve this first with an Attraction
Offer.

SECTIO N II: ATTRACTION
OFFERS
How to turn eyeballs into money .
Attraction Offers generate leads and convert them into customers. They
turn advertising into money by offering something free or at a discount. We
do this because everyone wants  a great deal. In a great deal, customers get
far more value than the price they pay. Strangers can only take your word
on the value. But, they absolutely understand the price. For that reason,
discounts make anything  a great deal to just about anyone . And, the greate r
the discount, the better the deal. The greatest discount of all being free.
So first off, any time I say “free” you can also use “discount” or “$1.”
Any time I use “discount” you can also use “free” or “$1” and so on. They
exist on a continuum because they all discount a product to some level—
even if you discount it by 100%!

If you can imag ine a way to use a discount or a free offer...the n you can
do it. After that, I’ll let you use your noggin to exchange them as you see
fit.
So How Do You Make Money By Offering Fr ee Stuff?
Think about it this way—people  look for one thing and then buy another
by accident all the time. Attraction Offers get them to do it on purpose . But
what’ s a better deal than free stuff? More and better free stuff. One free
thing is awesome. Two free things are awesomer . And, maybe to get those
two free things,  they have to buy one. That’ s how we make money on free
stuff.
In this section, I go over my five favorite ways to make money by offering
free stuf f:
1. Win Your Money Back
2. Giveaways
3. Decoy Offer
4. Buy X Get Y Free
5. Pay Less Now or Pay More Later
Let’s make some money .
