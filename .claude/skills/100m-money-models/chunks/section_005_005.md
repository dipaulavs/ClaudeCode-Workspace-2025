Solve rich people pr oblems, they pay better .
Anytime you offer something next, you upsell. Upsells play a key role in
Money Models by getting more cash from customers faster  than you
otherwise would  have. And if your Attraction Offer already covers the costs
of getting customers and delivering— more money ain’ t a bad thing.
I showed you the four most powerful Upsells I use: The Classic Upsell,
Menu Upsells, Anchor Upsells, and Rollover Upsells. They are core to my
business success. Upsells change everything. Many businesses go from
burning cash to printing it— overnight .
But, as you know, business isn’t all sunshine and rainbows. Sometimes,
people say no. This leads us to the next component of a $100M Money
Model —Downsell Of fers: what to do when they say no…

SECTION IV : DOWNSELL
OFFERS
What to offer when they say no.
In the last section, we used Upsell Offers to get people to buy more stuff.
If we did a good job, we’ve turned a profit too. Another step forward!
Awesome…but what if they say no? → We downsell them.
Downselling tweaks the original offer to find the highest value solution
for the customer ’s budget.  So any offer you make after someone says ‘no’ is
a downsell.
I downs ell in two ways.  I change  how they pay or what they get. For how
they pay, I balan ce how much they pay now with how much they pay over
time. For what they get, I change quantity , quality , or offer something
different.
First, we cover my rules of downselling— they apply to all my downsell
processes. Then, when we dive into individual offers, you can hit the
ground running and downsell like a pro.

How Not To Downsell—A  Real Story Fr om A Friend.
“I was buying a car and the salesman tried to upsell car insurance.
The cost of the insurance when he first started was $5,000. I said no.
But then, he lower ed the price. And I said no again. He kept lowering
the price until the same insurance  he first offered  for $5,000 was
now only $400! I still said no. At first I said no because it was too
much money, but by the end I said no because I didn’ t trust the guy.
The entire experience felt dirty. Then I wonder ed, was he ripping me
off on the car too? Now , I didn’ t want to buy the car fr om him either!”
People lower the price to close a sale. But even if you close this
one sale, the customer will question every price you offer from
that point going forward…and whoever they tell. You trade trust
for a buck. Not worth it.
Note: You can offer something different for less. You just can’t
offer the same thing for less. If he had offered differ ent insurance
for less, rather than the same insuran ce for less, he probably
would’ve kept her trust and closed the sale.
The Rules of Downselling
Remember , They Said No To This Offer, Not All Offers.  Sometimes (a
lotta times) people say no… and that’s OK. Just because they rejected this
offer  does not mean they rejected  you. It hurts  when someone rejects you. I
get it. But see it for what it is—an opportunity to find out what they really

want, and profit from it. Instead of hiding your head in the sand, stand your
ground and make another offer. No means no for this thing, not no for
everything.
Downsells Are Trades. When downselling, you work with the customer
to find combinations of giving and getting until you get a match.  If you’r e
gonna give something, get something.
Personalize, Don’t Pressur e. Figure out what they like and don’t like.
Then, offer more of what they like and less of what they don’t—with a
price to match.  You’re personalizing here. If someone refuses my large soda
upsell, I can offer alternatives. I could ask if they want a small, a juice, or a
coffee. Am I being offensive by asking? Absolutely not. In fact, if I can
better serve them, it would be of fensive not to.
Offer  The Sam e Things In New Ways. In a perfect world, you’ve got
tons of different things to sell so everyone buys something. In the real
world, you limit downsells to what you’ve got. Otherwise, you create a
hundred busines ses’ worth of products (and problems). A silly choice. So
just think of downselling more like a hundred ways to offer the stuff you
already have.
Don’t Drop Your Price Just To Get Somebody To Buy. First off,
dropping your price is not really downselling, it’s discounting . If someone
wants what you have, and just doesn’ t want to pay the price—tough
cookies. On the other hand, you can offer them to pay less now and more
money over time—a payment plan. But, whatever you do, don’t change the
price just to get someone to buy because…
Customers Talk About Price. By all means, test prices. Plan to offer
your thing at a specific price, to a specific number of people, ahead of time.
That’ s way different than charging somebody less in the moment just
because you felt scared of losing  the sale in the moment . Custom ers talk. If
they find out someone got the same thing for less “just because” —you’ll
upset people. And it also becom es an ethical problem, at least to me. Avoid
it.
