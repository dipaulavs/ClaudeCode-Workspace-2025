If you do X, Y , Z, I’ll let you start for fr ee.
Spring 2018.
Gym Launch was scaling fast. With 100 employees and counting, Leila
needed better HR solutions to manage it all. After months of sales calls with
prospective HR companies, she found one she liked. And to my surprise, it
wasn’ t anything special—it looked like all the others.
“Yeah, the software is complicated,” she said. “But they got me.”
“Seriously? How did they manage that?”
“They had a trial of fer with a weird spin. It was pretty smart.”
“What did they of fer?”
“They said if I did their training I’d get free onboarding. But, if I skipped
the training I’d have to pay for it!”
“So what did you do?”
“I went through the training of course.”
“So they took your credit card, you did the training— then you didn’ t have
to pay for the onboar ding? ”
“Yep!” she smirked. “And now I can actually use the complicated
software too.”

Lightbulb moment.
“Wait…you said no. Then, they downsold you a free trial on the condition
that they could penalize  you if you didn’ t use it?”
“Basically . I mean, it makes sense. It forced me to learn, and now I don’t
want to learn anyone else’s complicated software…so we’re sticking with
them!”
“You’re right. That is pretty smart.”

The software company used Trial With Penalty as their Attraction  offer—
but I prefer to downsell trials. So, I only downsell the trial if they say no to
my first offer. And if you do it the way I’m about to show you, it only
changes what they pay today —not how much they pay in total .
Description
In a Trial With Penalty offer, customers can try your product or service for
free so long as they meet your terms. For compariso n, Win Your Money
Back Offers (Attraction Offer #1) give customers the chance to get their
money back if they meet the terms.  In Trial With Penalty Offers, customers
only pay if they don’ t meet the terms.
Ideally , the terms should be things that make excellent customers. So,
they’ll mirror the actions and results used in your Win Your Money Back
Offer. But this time, we use avoiding fees (rather than winning money back)
to incentivize adherence.
So Trial With Penalty isn’t “here’ s my thing—see if you like it.” It’s
“here’s my thing, you get it for free so long as you do this stuff…which
makes you a perfect fit for my next offer. And if you don’t, then you have to
pay for it.”
To do a Trial With Penalty downsell, you must consider what they have to
do to avoid the fee, and how you charge them. Normally , you get one chunk
of people to buy your main offer. So, offer that first. And the rest, you’ll get
on this downsell. Let’s say you normally close three of ten people on your
Attraction Offer. And now you downsell another  four on a Trial With
Penalty . Then, after the trial finishes, upsell three of them. You go from
three sales to six sales— doubling your customers! If you only have one

offer, you lose everyone who says no. Downselling trials with a penalty
gives people another chance to say yes.
I’m still irritated at the thousands  of custo mers I’ve lost on free trials over
the years before learning this. But now we can save them! The Trial With
Penalty makes it happen.

Important Notes
What They Get For Free And What They Have To Do To Avoid The
Fee. You’ll need to know what your terms of service  will be. The valuable
parts will be either your bare bones offer (like the Decoy Offer) or your
Win Your Money Back offer. Either work. I’d recommend giving more
rather than givin g less—if you can afford it. The criteria should activate and
retain customers . You can swipe these directly from Win Your Money Back
—Attraction Of fer #1.
Breaking Up Fees vs. One Lum p Fee. Say you have a $500 product with
ten things to do. I’d rather bill $50 for each mess up than one $500 fee on
their first mess up. On the other hand, if missing once really messes up their
success, you’ll want the fee to reflect that. I’ve seen both work.
How To Downsell The Trial. Here’ s a graphic to show how I downsell a
Trial with Penalty in five steps.
Offer  The Trial Last. If someone makes it clear they don’t want your
first offer, then downsell the Trial With Penalty . Here’ s how it might
sound: “Hmmm...that sure is a pickle. I’ll tell ya what. How about we just
get ya started for free, would you be okay with that? We can just help you

out, and if you like it, you can stay. Let me get your ID and we can get the
process started—fair enough?”
Always Get A Credit Card. Record their info, hold onto the ID, and
motion for their credit card saying.  “What card do you wanna use?”  They
have to leave a card. If they balk, just say “That’ s just how we’ve always
done it.”  If they still refuse, wish them a lovely day and show them out.
Pro Tip: If someone doesn’t agree to put their card down and do
the work, I won’t sell them. They complain more and they
convert less. Not worth the hassle.
Always Sell Staying And Payin g. Ask directly : “If this program got you
the result, will you stay long-term?”  You want them to agree to staying
long-term if you get them results. If they say no, there’ s no point in giving
them a trial.
Then, we frame  the conversation as if they’ll stay long-term, even if we
haven’ t started billing them yet. So if they say ‘no,’ but want more
explanation, say something like this: “I don’t want you to try it. I want you

to get results. And out of integrity , I want to set realistic goals. You are not
going to hit your long-term goals during this trial. But, you will establish
habits that will help you get there. And we’re gonna help you do that for
free. But if you wanna get to your long-term results, you’r e gonna have to
stay on after. I just wanna make sure that you’r e not looking for a quick fix
—because I can’ t ethically pr omise you that.”
Once they agree, move on.
Explain the fees after  getting their  card. I say something like:“We will
do our part so long as you do yours . That’ s fair right? So now I just ask that
you bet on yourself—if you miss or skip any stuff, your results  will suffer .
We charge to keep you on track. If you miss, no big deal. You’ll get dinged a
little fee but it’ll get you back on track. If you follow through, you get all
this for free. So this is the best way we can get you amazing results and keep
it free for you. Best of both worlds.”
Note: If you explain the fees befor e you get the card, you will get more
resistance. So explain after  with a ‘this is just how we’ve always done it’
attitude. People still have to agree to the fees, but you’ll get a higher take
rate doing it this way. I always have customers initial separately  next to the
fee clauses to force my sales guys to explain them.


Make Check-in s Requir ed. First, we expla in all criteria so they
understand the costs and benefits of adhering. Then, we draw attention
to check -ins (our upsell opportunities): “Yep, and you agree to attend
each of the three check-ins. The first we do X so that you can [benefit
one], the second we do Y so that you can [benefit two]…, the third we
do Z so that you can [benefit three]… Obviously we charge if you miss
these because it’ s the only way we can get you r esults.”

How I Upsell From A Trial. When someone  takes a trial, one of three
things happen: they like it, they hate it, or they don’t use it. Here’ s how I
upsell them from each scenario.
1. If they like it: This is the easy one. You already have them set up
for automatic billing. Great! Meet with them anyway. You can
still offer a longer term or higher value version of your service
(or both). Successful customers tend to get even more value out
of your better (and more profitable) stuff.
2. If they hate it: Turn that frown upside down. Ask them what they
would have liked to be different. Tell them they’re totally right,
and that you’re angry at yourself for missing this. Do not blame
them. Only one person can be angry—and it needs to be you. Ask
if they’ll give you a chance to make it up because of how
outraged you are at their experience. And now, since you better
understand their needs, that they’re a better fit for your higher
level thing. Then, offer it to them. Yes—this is a sale. I can get
about half of these people to buy.
3. If they didn’t use it. Reach out to people multiple times before
you get to this point. Explain that you need to meet with them.
Offer to waive the fee if they do. Now, you can try to get them
back on track or offer something better for them. I don’t like
billing non-starters. A small fee isn’t worth a 1-star review. But
hey, it’s your choice.
Tweak Your Trial To Get The Most Customers. If no one takes your
Trial, lower the requirements or penalties. If people take your Trial but
don’t follow through, emphasiz e explaining how fees help them and make
sure you include sales meetings as mandatory . If people don’t stay on the
back end, better emphasize the value of staying and paying, get better at
delivering, and make sure what you sell on the back end makes sense  with
what you sell on the front end. If you start printing money , don’ t stop.
Let People Make Up For Goofs. People  often get discouraged after
getting billed. But, you can offer an opportunity to ‘make it up.’ This does a
great job of getting people back on track and converting. But, if they miss
that, you’re justified in billing them.

Just Call It A Trial. Even though the Trial With Penalty has some
‘special features,’  you should just call it a Free Trial. Otherwise, people may
get scared and confused. No one wants to be penalized. And if they ask you
why you do Free Trials this way just reply with “This is just how we’ve
always done it”  or “People get the best r esults this way .”
Pay Less Now or Pay More Later  vs. Trial With Penalty . I use Pay
Less Now or Pay More Later as a downsell for physical produ cts or one-
time services. And I use Trial With Penalty as a downsell for recurring
products or services. Also, I have only made this work in businesses where
the customer has to do work to get results. If you find other types of
businesses these work for…let me know!
Discounts Get Cards on File. Some people get weird when you offer free
stuff and ask for a card. And if you have a super low price, it justifies asking
for the card. The small price means the card will probably work when the
automatic paym ents start. So instead of a free month, you might offer “first
month for $1” then $X per month when it recurs.
Summary Points
In a Trial With Penalty offer, customers can try your product or
service for free so long as they meet your terms.
Trial With Penalty downsell offers get yeses from people who’ve
said no.
To do them, you: get the card, get the commitment, explain what
they have to do to get results and the meetings they must attend,
and what happens if they don’t.
Trials With Penalties get more paying customers than normal free
trials because they use your product more and actually get value
from it.
Use the same ‘refund’ criteria from Win Your Money Back
(Attraction Offer #1) to create your Trial With Penalty criteria. This
way, at the end of the trial, they’ve done the stuff that makes great
long-term customers (and advertise your business for free).
You can break fees up by criteria or you can charge a lump fee. I
like breaking them up.

You make money by getting people results and turning them into
customers, not nickeling and diming people with fees.
Use mid-trial check-ins to make more offers. If they love it, give
them more of what they love. If they have problems with it, swap it
for what makes sense for them. If they aren’t using it, offer them
the ability to make it up to avoid the fees.
FREE GIFT : Free Trial Training
Not all businesses can do free trials. But if you can, it’s a
helluva downsell. There’ s obviously right and wrong ways to do
them and right and wrong businesses to do them in. I made a
free video for you covering this chapter and as many details as
I could. You can watch it at acquisition.com/training/money . I
put a QR code for fast easy access.
