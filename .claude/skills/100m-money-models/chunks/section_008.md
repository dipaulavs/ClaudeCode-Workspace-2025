Premium Offer:  We can help you implement all this stuff for $16,000 over
16 weeks.

If they took the premium option, they’d get a treasure trove of money-
making tactics. Tactics that took me years to figure out. People bought left
and right.  And whoosh, my Decoy Offer took me to $476,000 per month in
three months . Not a typo.
But I had a problem. Since I only had one thing to sell, I knew my
revenue would plateau fast. I need ed an upsell to raise profits or Gym
Launch would stagnate. So I crafted an Upsell Offer for the more advanced
gym owners. I called it “Gym Lords” and priced it at $42,000 per year. I
used the Classic Upsell  to offer advanced playbooks and services. And a
community to share best pract ices as a Continuity Bonus. I started by
offering a hefty $6,000 discoun t for anyone who prepaid. Many gym
owners paid for it up front with money I had just made them. For the ones
who didn’ t, I of fered a Payment Plan Downsell .
If they said no, I went for $10,000 down and spread the rest over time. If
they said no again, I’d go for ~$800 per week for 52 weeks. If they said no
again , I said they could start for free. I’d use a Continuity Discount  to
frontload the free time for as long as it took them to finish paying off the
first offer. Then,  they’d roll right into my continuity upsell. This way, their
payments stayed continuous. And zoom…The Classic Upsell + Continuity
Bonus + Payment Plan Downsell + Continuity Discount took me to
~$1,500,000 per month.
I had another thing to sell. Woo! And it exploded Gym Launch ’s Money
Model to the next level. But, I still had work to do. Even though the upsell
and downsell process worked well, some gym owner s kept saying no. I went
back to the drawing board.
I came up with a more personalized Menu Upsell  with different levels of
service. I offered done-for -you advertising. I offered sales team training. I
offered turnkey campaigns to make quick cash. And finally , I offered a
minimum package—continuou s access to the original Gym Launch
materials with tech support for a discounted monthly rate. If they didn’ t
want the whole package, I used Feature Downsells  to find the best option
for them. Almost everyone stayed for something.
And wham…Menu Upsells + Feature Downsells took me to $2,300,000
per month. All within 14 months.
Then we started Prestige Labs  and integrated it with Gym Launch. A
totally different business with its own Money Model. By month 20, we

were raking in $4,400,000 per month . It was life-changing. And it *only*
took a  few darn good pr oducts  and a $100M Money Model to do it.

Author  Note: When I started,  I didn’ t know any of this Money Model
stuff. It only looks clean looking back. But, I hope this simplifies things so
it takes you much less time than it took me.
Description
A Money Model is a deliberate sequence of offers . It’s what you offer,
when you offer, and how you offer it to make as much money as you can as
fast as you can. Ideally , to make enough money from one customer to get
and service at least two more customers in less than 30 days. And it rarely
looks clean, but I break $100M Money Models into three stages:
Stage I: Get Cash—Attraction Of fers get more customers for less
Stage II: Get More Cash—Upsell & Downsell Offers make more money
from them faster
Stage III: Get The Most Cash—Continuity Offers maximize their total
money spent
I break my $100M Money Model down into these stages because Money
Model growth happens alongside  the growth of the business. In other
words, if you try to start a boots trapped business, from zero, on your own,
with a “finished” Money Mode l… it will collapse on top of you. In fact,
none  of my businesses started with a fully forged Money Model. They all
start at Stage I. Even Acquisition.com! In my experience, Money Models
evolve like this:
First, I get customers reliably then
I make sure they pay for themselves reliably then
I make sure they pay for other customers reliably then
I start maximizing each customer’s long-term value then
I spend as many advertising dollars as I can to print as much
money as possible.

My Money Models develop this way because I make sure each stage pays
for the next. We keep improving each stage  until it gets reliable . Also, this
means financial and operational reliability . So fair warning: when your
Money Model starts working, your business starts breaking . Part of the
game. So I suggest you find someone who can build and lead the team that
makes your vision a reality . When I did, I married her. I hope the same luck
finds you.
Author  Note:  I want to make myself abundantly clear . Lots of
$100M Money Models  exist. I dare say a $100M Money Model
exists for every $100M business! Remember , plenty of
businesses make gobs of money in plenty of ways. I just show
the ways I have actually done it.

Make Your Own Money Model
Step 1) Start With An Attraction Offer . The goal is to turn strangers
into customers and cover our costs. So, figure out what you’re going to sell.
Then, figure out the best way to present it. The Attraction Offer section has
my top favorites: Win Your Mon ey Back, Giveaways, Decoy Offers, Buy X
Get Y Free, Pay Less Now or Pay More Later . Then, advertise it. If you get
leads who turn into customers , you’re on your way. Figuring out what
works best may take up to a year. If you want to learn more about
advertising, make sure to check out my second book $100M Leads.
Step 2) Pick An Upsell Offer . The goal is to get 30-day profits well
above our costs of getting a new custo mer and delivering what you offer to
them. Remember , once you solve a problem, another appears. Those
problems also need solutions. You solve the problems your Attraction Offer
creates with Upsell Offers. So pick the Upsell Offer that best matches the
problem you solve and how you solve it. The Upsell Offer section gives you
my four favorites: The Class ic Upsell, Menu Upsell, Anchor Upsell,
Rollover Upsell. Then, make your of fer at their time of greatest need.
Step 3) Pick A Downsell Offer . The goal is to get customers who said no
to your last offer to say yes to another offer. This way, you’ll sell way more
people  than you otherwise would—so you make more total cash from the
same number of leads. The Downsell Offer section shows you my three
favorites. If you want to keep your price the same, change  how they pay
with Payment Plan Downsells or Trials. If you want to charge less, change

what they get with Feature Downsells. And best of all, you can alternate
between them in the same sale. The more flexible you make your offers, the
more people will buy them.
Step 4) Pick A Continuity Offer . The goal here is to get one last sale in
our 30-day wind ow and stack recurring cash. So, I try to include continuity
in busin ess eventually . My three favor ite Continuity Offers are: Continuity
Bonuses, Continuity Discounts, and Waived Fee Of fers.
Sometimes the best timing for Continuity Offers happens after  the first
thirty days, and that’s OK. It’s better to make the offer at the right time than
to try and for ce it at the wr ong time.
Author  Note: Bootstrapped Businesses Must Get Customers At A
Profit.
Unless you get outside investors…start with a fortune…or , have
an endless source of free customers…achieving a Money Model
is the only way you can profitably scale. Otherwise, you run out of
cash and go out of business before you even have a chance.
Important Notes
Perfect One Offer  At A Time. It’s tempting to implement a whole Money
Model at once. Don’ t. Stick to your stage. Pick one offer. Try it. Keep doing
it until it works reliably . Then, after it’s reliable, do it so many times it gets
automatic. Then , go to the next stage.
Patience is still the fastest way to get to your goal. So you’ll need to
measure in quarters, not weeks . You either build it right or you build it
again. And again. And again. Building again—no matter how fast—still
takes longer than building it right the first time.
Raise Price In Stages. Make new offers cheap at first. Then, as you get
yeses, raise the price. Lots of early yeses get customer feedback and make
the product better. Then, as the offer gets reliable, start raisin g the price.
And keep raising the price until you cannot make up for the nos with the
extra cash you make from the yeses. In other words, keep raising the price
until you make less money .

Simple Scales. Fancy Fails. Get as much as you can out of what you
have. Remember , it’s less about having 100 products to offer, and more
about having 100 ways to offer your product. Think more ways to sell the
same thing, not more things to sell. If I offer personal training, I can offer
one, two, three, four etc. sessions per week.  This turns one product into
many offers.
*IMPOR TANT* Affiliate Products Can Fill Money Model Gaps.  An
affiliate relationship just means you sell other peoples’  stuff for a
commission. If you don’t have anything to offer, and want to start a
business, you can offer somebody else’s stuff. If you have a single offer,
and want to add more offers to your Money Model, you can offer somebody
else’s stuff. If you have a $100M business, and want to make more money
without adding the operational headache, you can offer somebody else’s
stuff. In short, you can always offer somebody else’s stuff in your Money
Model. Here are a few examples:
Service: A dental agency sends their dentist clients to a braces
manufacturer. The manufacturer sends them commissions for each
dentist client they send. More money. No extra work. Voila.
Local Business: A massage therapist sells their clients somebody
else’s home massage tools, exercise bands, medicine balls, etc. The
customer pays through the therapist, and the other company ships it
right to the customer. A few extra words. A lot of extra money. No
extra service delivered.
Digital Product: An educator tells his clients to use a specific
customer service software. The software company sends the
consultant a commission for every sign-up.
Turn Attraction Offers Into Continuity Offers With Automatic
Renewal.  This makes it a two-for -one. For example, if you do a Buy 6
Months Get 6 Months Free Offer, they can roll automatically into a month-
to-month subscr iption at the end of 12 months. This gets the benefits of
Attraction and Continuity Of fers. A small tip with big implications.
You Can Mix And Match Offers However  You Want. I presen t offers
this way because that’s how I use them. But if you recall, I learned many of
them from peop le who used them  differently than me! Many of these offers
you can use anywher e. You can use Upsell tactics in your Attraction Offer.

You can install a Downsell process with every  offer. You can use a
Continuity Offer to attract new customers. There are no rules. You can do
whatever you want. I show you stuff one way, but I fully expect you to use it
in another . So, start with the way I sugg est it. Then, as you get better ,
experiment. It’ s how I learned this stuf f. And it’ s how you’ll learn it too.
Summary
A Money Model is a deliberate sequence of offers.
Money Models have three stages: Get Cash (Attraction Offers), Get
More Cash (Upsells & Downsells), Get The Most Cash (Continuity
Offers).
To make your own Money Model, start with an Attraction Offer.
Once it gets you customers and cash, add an Upsell Offer. From
there, add Downsell Offers to get even more people to buy. Then,
finally add in your Continuity Offer.
Do not try and implement a full Money Model at once. It will break
your business.
Don’t start more businesses just to make more offers. It’s less about
having 100 products to offer, and more about having 100 ways to
offer your product.
To sell more stuff without starting 100 businesses, offer stuff from
other businesses and let them deliver.
Affiliate Relationships can fill gaps in your Money Model without
the headache of delivery.
Price new offers low enough that you will get lots of yeses. Use
customer feedback to improve your product. Then, start raising the
price until you stop making more money.
A $100M Money Model eliminates cash as a bottleneck for growth.
Mission accomplished.
