# Downsell Offers Conclusion

**Path:** Section IV: Downsell Offers/Downsell Offers Conclusion
**Type:** conclusion

---

Everybody buys something.
Downsells give you another shot at getting a customer by turning nos into
yeses. For that reason, it’s less about having a hundred different products
with the same offer, and more about having a hundre d different offers for
the same product.  But, no matter what, the offer is never the same stuff for
cheaper . We just keep tweaking the offer until we make it the best deal for
them . The extra cash explodes our 30-day profits and blows us past our
goals.
So we’ve used attraction offers to get customers to buy once.  We’ve used
upsells to get them to buy the next thing. And now I’ve shown you my three
most powerful downsell proce sses in case they say no: Payme nt Plan
Downsells, Trial With Penalty , and Feature Downsells.
Next, we’ve got the final stage  of a $100M Money Model —Continuity
Offers: how to keep them  buying for good.

SECTION V: CONTINUITY
OFFERS
You can shear a sheep for a lifetime, but you can only skin it once. - John,
an early mentor
I’ve been a continuity guy my entire life: personal fitness, then gyms, then
gym licensing, then supplements, then software, and now with
Acquisition.com…lots of stuff. Needless to say, I’m a fan. Main reason:
when you do continuity right, you get more customers and make more
money from them. Continuity Offers provide ongoing  value that customers
make ongoing payments for—until they cancel . They boost the profit from
every customer and give you one last thing to sell. Continuity  Offers are
awesome because you sell once, but get paid again and again.
Let me explain.
Let’s say you offer a $1,000 thing to 100 people and 10 buy— you make
$10,000 (10 x $1,000).
Now , let’s say you talk to the same 100 people but you make your $1,000
thing…$50 per month instead. At fifty bucks, we can get 40 out of 100 to

buy. And, if you keep those people for twenty months. You still make $1,000
from each customer . You go from making $10,000 now and $0 over time to
$2,000 now and $40,000 over time.
As an added bonus, in the first example, if you only sold 10 customers,
you’d only have 10 customers to upsell later. If you used a Cont inuity Offer
and sold 40 customers, you’d have four times the custo mers to upsell later.
A massive dif ference.
This illustrates the pros and cons of continuity . You can attract more
customers comp ared to something more expensive, but you make way less
money now. That makes it tough to use as an Attraction Offer on its own.
Even if you have more money-making potential tomorrow , Continuity
Attraction Of fers leave you strapped for cash today .
By making continuity offers last, we get the best of all worlds. We get
cash today from Attraction Offers, Upsell Offers, and Downsell Offers. We
get a little cash today and tons of cash tomorrow from Continuity Of fers.
To be clear—you can make Continuity Offers wherever and however you
want. They can attract new customers, upsell and down sell current
customers, or re-engage old customers.
Also, only some  stuff makes sense for a Conti nuity Offer. It’s silly for
someone to pay for a one-day workshop…forever . It makes sense for them
to pay until they cover the cost—and that makes it a payment plan. At the
same time, you probably make a mistake to offer a single price (even a big
price) to provide  a service forever . If your customers get ongoing value, it
probably makes sense for them to make ongoing payments.
The Three Continuity Offers
All offers depend on getting customers to buy. But, Continuity Offers
depend on getting customers to keep buying. I get them to do both by
combining bonuses, discounts, and fees.
