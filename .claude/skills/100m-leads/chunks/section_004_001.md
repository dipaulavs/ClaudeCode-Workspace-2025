The Cor e Four Advertising Methods.
 
 
W e get engaged leads by letting people know about our stuf f. And
there are two types of people we let know: people who know us
and people who don’ t. And there are two paths of letting them
know about it: one-to-one and one-to-many . Those combine into
the four basic ways one person can let other people know about
anything. Let’ s break down how we can use those four ways to get
us leads.
 
 
T wo T ypes of Audiences: W arm and Cold

 
W arm audiences  are people who gave you permission to contact
them.  Think “people who know you” - aka - friends, family ,
followers, current customers, previous customers, contacts, etc.
 
Cold audiences  are people who have not given you permission to
contact them . Think “strangers” - aka - other peoples’ audiences:
buying contact lists, making contact lists, paying platforms for
access, etc.
 
The dif ference matters because it changes how  we advertise to
them.
 
 
T wo W ays T o Communicate: One to One (Private), One to
Many (Public)
 

 
W e can contact people 1-to-1 or 1-to-many . Another way of
thinking about this is private or public communication. Private
communication is when only one person gets a message at a time.
Think “phone call” or “email.” If you announce something
publicly , many people can get it at the same time. Think “social
media posts” or “billboards” or “podcasts.”
 
Now , automation can make this seem  confusing. Don’ t let it.
Automation just means some of the work is done by machines. The
nature of the communication stays the same. Email, for instance, is
one-to-one. Emailing a 10,000 person list “once” is more like one-
to-one r eally fast  by a machine. Automation, which we cover later ,
is one of the many ways we can get leads on steroids. Like
audiences, the dif ference between public and private
communication matters because they change how  we advertise.
 
 
Section III Outline: Get Leads
 

 
Combining warm and cold audiences with 1-to-1 and 1-to-many
leads us to the only four ways we can let anyone know about
anything: the core four . I combined them below for you.
 
1-to-1 to a W arm Audience = W arm Outreach 
 
1-to-many to a W arm Audience = Posting Content 
 
1-to-1 to a Cold Audience = Cold Outreach
 
1-to-many to a Cold Audience = Paid Ads
 
These are the only  four things you can do  to let other people know
about the stuf f you sell.  And each method takes us one step closer
to the land of overflowing leads. I refer to the core four throughout
the rest of the book - so get to know them. In fact, make them part
of yourself.
 
Once you do, you will have your own “get out of jail free” card to
carry around forever . It will give you as many chances to succeed
at business as you could ever want for the r est of your life . Or at
least, it has for me.
 

So if you aren’ t getting as many leads as you want, you’re not
doing the core four with enough skill or with enough volume. W e
cover all this stuf f in lots of detail. How they work. How to do
them. When to do them. And show how to measure your progress
along the way . This simplifies the overly confused world of
advertising into four core actions . Either do them and get as many
leads as you darn well please, or get crushed by those who do.
