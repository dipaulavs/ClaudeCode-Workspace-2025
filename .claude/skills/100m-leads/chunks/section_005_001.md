Get people who get you more leads
 
“Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it,
and I shall move the world.”              - Ar chimedes
 
 
Building A $100M Lead Machine Is All About Leverage
 
An old lady can lift a semi-truck with a long enough lever . The
strongest man in the world, without one, can’ t . The length of the
lever determines how much someone can lift. This is leverage. W e
can use the principle of leverage in advertising. Let me explain:
 

 
Someone with internet can send a message to millions of people at
once. Someone writing postcards by hand can’ t . The internet
allows us to reach more people for the same time spent. So, it’ s
higher leverage.
 
That means leverage boils down to how much we get for the time
we spend getting it. So we want to use higher leverage activities to
get what we want. More stuf f we want. Less time getting it. Good.
 
And we want leads.  Lots of leads.
 
 
 
 
Lead Getters Give Y ou Leverage
 

 
People can find out about the stuf f we sell from two sources. W e
can let them know using the core four . Or , other people  can let
them know using the core four . I call these other people lead
getters . When other people do it for us, we save time. That means
we get more engaged leads for less work. Leverage baby .
 
 
Imagine four scenarios:
 
Scenario #1: Y ou ar e  the lead getter .  Y ou do the core four all day
everyday by yourself. Y ou get enough leads to pay the bills.
 
 
W ork: HIGH Leads: LOW Leverage: LOW
 
Scenario #2: Y ou get  a lead getter .  Y ou get a lead getter to do the
core four on your behalf. Now , the lead getter brings enough leads
to pay the bills without you advertising. Y ou work less than
scenario #1 and get the same number of leads.
 

 
W ork: LOW . Leads: LOW . Leverage: HIGH.
 
Scenario #3: Y ou get lots of lead getters.  Y ou spend all your time
getting other lead getters. Y our leads go up every time you get
another one.  Y ou work all day everyday , but you get way more
leads than you did when it was just you. Y ou work more than
scenario #2 but get way  more leads.
 
 
W ork: HIGH. Leads: HIGH. Leverage: HIGHER.
 
Scenario #4: Y ou get a lead getter who gets lead getters.  Y ou
recruit somebody who recruits other people to advertise on your
behalf. They get more lead getters every month. Y ou only had to
work to get the first lead getter once , but his leads continue
climbing without you working. Y ou works less than scenario #3,
and you get more leads each and every month.
 

 
W ork: LOW . Leads: HIGH. Leverage: HIGHEST .
 
Now you’ve got the makings of a $100M Leads  machine.
 


 
Outline of The “Lead Getters” Section
 
The lead getters aren’ t part of the “core four” because they’re not
things you do. Y ou do not ‘do’ af filiates or ‘do’ customer referrals
or ‘do’ agencies or ‘do’ employees.  But, you have to do the cor e
four to get them . They come from warm outreach, cold reach outs,
posting content, and running paid ads. And once you get them, they
do it for you.
 
So the core four stacks. One time to get them, and a second time
for when lead getters get engaged leads on your behalf. But it
doesn’ t have to end there. In fact, it shouldn’ t. The process repeats.
Lead getters can go get lead getters! So we do something once then
lead getters can do it forever .
 
But wait, I thought this book was about getting leads? So am I
trying to get leads? Or do I want lead getters? Answer: Y es. Lead
getters start out as leads, then get interested in the stuf f you sell
and become engaged leads like anyone else. The dif ference is they
get other people interested in the stuf f you sell, too! And ideally ,
every lead becomes a lead getter .
 
The following chapters explain, in detail, how to get other people
to advertise for you . And, if you want to scale to $100M+, you
have to understand them:
 
#1 Customers - they buy your stuf f then tell other people about it
to get you leads.
 
#2 Employees - people in your business that get you leads .
 

#3 Agencies-  businesses with services that get you leads .
 
#4 Affiliates -  businesses who tell their audiences about your stuf f
to get you leads.
 
*All four lead getters let other people know about your  stuf f. In
other words, all four are higher leverage than you doing it on your
own.
 
Once you do understand the four lead getters, you can build a lead
getting machine for every company you start for the rest of your
life. I’ll break down how I use all four lead getters. How each is
dif ferent. How to work with them. When to use them. Best
practices. And how to measure your progress along the way . At the
end of this section, you will understand how to get other people to
bring you more leads than you can possibly imagine.
 
And since we already use the core four to get customers, let’ s start
with something we can do right now–get those customers to refer
more customers.
