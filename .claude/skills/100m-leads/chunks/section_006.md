“The last skill you ever need to learn is how to get other people to
do everything you need for you.”
 
W e do the core four to get engaged leads: warm outreach, post
content, cold outreach, and paid ads. And we use them to get two
types of engaged leads: the ones that become customers, or the
ones we turn into lead getters. Lead getters come in four flavors:
Referrers, Employees, Agencies, and Af filiates. Each have key
strengths:
 
Customer referrals have the biggest potential for low-cost
exponential growth.
 
Employees have your dir ect  influence and run your business on
your behalf.
 
Agencies teach skills you keep forever and can transfer to your
team.
 
Af filiates, once you get them going, can operate entirely on their
own.
 
Y ou can either do the advertising or other people can. And there
are more “other people” than there are of you. Y ou get mor e leads
for the work you do when you have help.  So if you want to get a
ton of leads, this is the way .
 
Maybe your head is of ficially spinning. Now that you understand
these advertising methods, you see leads everywhere you look. W e

have so many ways to gr ow! And you’d be right. But...you don't
know which one to focus on.
 
Any or all of these lead methods can underpin a successful lead-
getting strategy , and I put them in the order of what happens
naturally . If you start on your own, you tend to get your first
referrals before you start building a big team. And when you start
building a big team (employees) you’ll probably start looking for
professional help (agencies). And only when a business owner has
a handle on managing people inside of their business do they tend
to get the guts to try and manage people outside their business
(af filiates). In any case, you have to for get the idea that everything
is going to work out the first time.
 
If you think you’re going to become a millionaire the first year you
go out on your own, you’re probably wrong. It’ s very unlikely .
And an obsession with “getting rich quick” will likely ensure it
never happens. People try shortcuts for a decade until they realize
they should have picked a strategy and stuck with it for a decade. If
you do that, success is inevitable. Once you find something that
works for you– stick to what you pick. Those are the best words of
encouragement I can of fer . The longer you play the game, the
better you will get, and the more success you will have.  Just don't
quit or switch methods after seeing a few losses . It’ s normal to lose
in the beginning. In fact, I expect  to crack a new lead source in
three to six months (and this isn’ t my first rodeo). So if your
expectations are faster  than that, do you think your expectations
are reasonable?              
 
W e covered a lot here. This section was how you scale: you get
other people to help you. They are the missing link. Each has their
own strategy and best practices. Use what applies to you now .
 

This leads us to Section V : Get Started. I want to put everything
together for you in a nice bow so you know exactly what to do
next . T ogether , we’ll eliminate  leads as the bottleneck in your
business forever .  Onwards!
