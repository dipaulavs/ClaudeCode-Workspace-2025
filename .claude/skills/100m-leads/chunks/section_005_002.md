“The best sour ce of new work, is the work on your desk” - Charlie
Munger
 
 
October 2019.
 
Leila and I sat together on her parents’ living room couch. The one
she watched movies on as a kid. The faded edges of the cof fee
table begged us to kick our feet up. W e balanced laptops on our
thighs. Extension cords snaked around the couch to outlets down
the hall. Her stepmother clanged in the kitchen. This was not  a
work environment. But, we made due.
 
T wo years earlier , I lost everything and met her parents on the
same weekend…
 

Hey dad, I met this guy on the internet. He lost everything and has
no money . But don’ t worry , I quit my job and moved in with him to
help with his next big business idea. By the way , can we crash her e
for a while?’
 
… Gr eat  first impression, Alex.
 
But a lot had changed since then. W e were multi-millionaires now .
W e made enough to buy her childhood home in cash. Every week.
 
Leila reviewed reports from our department heads. Oh yeah, we
had executives now , too.
 
“Hey , sales numbers look a little soft this week.” she said.
 
“Really? How many did we close?”
 
“Fifteen. And sales started dipping last week too. Is there anything
dif ferent on your end?”
 
“I don't know . Let me check.” I logged into Facebook’ s advertising
portal. Red rejection notifications filled the screen.
 
“W elp. That’ll do it” I said.
 
“What? What happened?”
 
“All the ads got shut of f.”
 

“W ell…that’ s a problem. When do you think you can get them
back up?”
 
“It’ll take a day or two to get a new campaign started.”
 
I squinted at the screen. Something even more alarming jumped at
me. Facebook r ejected the ads two weeks ago. I acted like nothing
was wrong.
 
“So we closed 15 this week, and how many the week before?” I
asked.
 
“21”
 
“W ell, I’ve got good news and I’ve got bad news.”
 
“Uhh…Ok…”
 
“The bad news is…the ads got shut of f two weeks ago, so that
explains the dip. The good news is…our product is so good that
we’re still doing $500,000 a week from word of mouth alone.
 
“Y ou ignored the ads for two weeks!?” She had oh no you didn’ t
written all over her face.
 
I shrugged with a sheepish grin. “Y ou still love me, right?”
 
W e busted out laughing at the absurdity of it all.
 

Those two years were insane. The amount of money we were
making didn't make sense. W e didn’ t comprehend how much until
years later . W e were just grateful to be doing this together , flaws
and all. And this accidental stretch without running paid ads made
something very clear: Our customers wer e telling their friends.
 
 
**A few months later**
 
I stood on stage and looked out over the 700+ gym owner
audience. Everyone paid $42,000 to be there. All wore black “Gym
Lord” t-shirts and stick-on mustaches. It. W as. Nuts.
 
I was mid-presentation, explaining how excellent service generates
leads through word of mouth. All the while, I obsessed over
whether the money we made during two weeks without running
paid ads was a fluke. Feeling confident, I paused the presentation.
T ime to find out :
 
“Alright, just to show you how important this is, who here learned
about Gym Launch from another gym owner? Raise your hand.”
As soon as the words left my lips, I felt instant regret. What if no
one raises their hand? What if our gr owth was all for ced? I’m such
an idiot.
 

I looked around the room with my arm raised like a monkey . The
room stood still. Oh no.
 
Then…a few gym owners raised their hands. That doesn’ t look
gr eat, but it could be worse . Then, more. Thank God. Then, more.
Then, a wave  of hands. Holy cow . People looked to their sides and
behind them. It was almost the entir e r oom . I let the moment sink
in for all of us. I’ll never for get it. I knew we had good word of
mouth, but not this  good.
 
“That” I said, “is the power of word of mouth.”
 
***
 
I know you weren’ t there when Leila and I realized we were
making $500,000+ per week from word of mouth. I know you
weren’ t there to see $30M in customers say someone referred
them. The first time I realized the power of referrals - it was by
accident . Seeing how much it made me, I studied what had gone
right. I wanted to make sure I could recreate it on purpose . For me
to transfer that ability to you, I have to transfer the beliefs that
created it. And these experiences formed those beliefs. This is why
I shar e them.
 
People copied our of fers, ads, and lead magnets. They copied our
landing pages, emails, and sales scripts. They copied everything
they could–but they did it with little success. They think it’ s about
"advertising," and it is. But the best  advertising is a happy
customer . An amazing product turns every customer into a lead
getter .
 
The world loses trust by the second. Every day , more customers do
their research. They arm themselves with information to make

purchasing decisions. As well they should. So to play at higher
levels, we need our product to not only deliver ... but  delight .
Customers must get so much value  it compels them to tell other
people about us. The good news is, once you know how , it’ s easier
than you think.
 
In this chapter , I explain how to get the lowest cost, highest profit,
and best quality leads out there: referrals.
 
 
How Referrals W ork
 
A referral happens when somebody , a referrer , sends an engaged
lead to your business. Anyone can refer , but the best referrals come
from your customers. So this chapter focuses on getting more
referrals from your customers.
 
How Referrals Gr ow Y our Business
 
Referrals are important because they grow your business in two
ways:
 
1 . They’r e worth mor e (higher L TGP).  Referrals buy more
expensive stuf f and buy it more times. They also tend to pay in

cash upfront. Lovely .
 
2 . They cost less (lower CAC) . If one customer sends you another
customer because they like your stuf f, that new customer costs
you nothing. And free customers are cheaper than customers that
cost money . So free customers = good.
 
But what does this stuf f really mean? Check this out…imagine you
had an L TGP to CAC ratio of 4 to 1. That means it costs twenty-
five percent of your lifetime gross profit of one customer to get
another . Not bad. But now imagine if every customer br ought you
two mor e customers.  Y ou’d now have an L TGP to CAC ratio of 12
to 1– you’d use just over 8.3% of your lifetime gross profit to get a
new customer . So you get three customers for the price of one.
Now we’re talking. Hooray . What a deal! On top of that, r eferrals
ar e exponential . Let me explain.
 
 
The number of engaged leads you get from the core four depends
on how much  you do them. The inputs to outputs have pretty linear
relationships. If you do 100 reach outs you get engaged leads. If

you double it, your leads roughly double. If you spend $100 on
ads, you get engaged leads. If you double it, your leads roughly
double. So no matter how well you advertise, how much you get
depends on how much you do. And that’ s great. But with word of
mouth, we can do even better . W ith word of mouth, one customer
brings two. T wo bring four . Four bring eight. And so forth. It’ s not
linear , it’ s exponential .
 
Nothing scales like wor d of mouth.  W ant to know why so few
people scale by word of mouth? They lose customers faster than
they get them. Look at the referral growth equation to see it in
action. Referrals (in) minus churned customers (out).
 
 
If referrals are greater than churn: you grow without any other
advertising (yay!)
 
If referrals are equal to churn: you need other advertising to
grow your business (meh)
 
If referrals are less than churn: you’ve got to advertise to break
even (boo - most folks)
 
This gets nutty when you look at percentages. If the percentage of
referrals every month is bigger than the percentage of customers
who leave, your business compounds every month. Y ou’d have to
spend that much more money on ads, do that many more reach

outs, or post that much more content just to maintain that growth.
Y ou eventually hit a wall. But with referrals, you can maintain
growth no matter how big you get . This is how companies like
PayPal and Dropbox exploded into multibillion dollar businesses.
I’ll break down their exact strategies later in the chapter .
 
On the other hand, small businesses barely scrape by because they
have about the same customers exiting as they do entering. A
hamster wheel of death. Here’ s why…
 
 
T wo Reasons Most Businesses Don’t Get Referrals
 
Most businesses don’ t get referrals for two reasons. First, their
product isn’ t as good as they think it is. Second, they don’ t ask for
them.
 
 
Problem #1: The Product Isn’ t Good Enough

 
“Everyone loves our stuff, we just need to get the wor d out!”  - says
every small business owner with a product that’ s not as good as
they think it is.
 
I’m gonna take of f my nice guy hat for a second. If your product
were exceptional, people would already know about it and you’d
have more business than you could handle. So if you sell direct to
consumers and they are not bringing you more customers, your
product has room to improve.
 
I like to ask myself: “Why are my customers too embarrassed to
tell everyone they know about my product?” It may be okay , but
it’ s unr emarkable , as in - not worthy of remark.
 
In fact, most of the stuf f I pay for , kind of sucks. My pool guy
for gets stuf f half the time. My landscapers make tons of noise at
the worst hours. My cleaners routinely put my clothes in my wife's
closet (I guess that’ s what I get for extra schmedium t-shirts). The
list goes on.
 
Business owners wonder why they don’ t get referrals. The answer
is right in front of them. They'r e just not good enough.  Let me
show you how I think about it:
 

 
Price is what you char ge. V alue is what they get. The dif ference
between price and value is goodwill .
 
This means that price not only communicates value, but it’ s also
how we judge  value. Economics dorks call it ‘customer surplus’.
But I’m just gonna call it goodwill. Y ou want lots of goodwill. Lots
of goodwill creates word of mouth. W ord of mouth means
referrals.
 
There are two ways to build goodwill with your customers. Y ou
can lower your price or you can give more value. After all, if you
lower the price of your product enough, people would line up to
get it. But you’d probably lose money . So, lowering the price is, at
best, a temporary solution. Y ou can only lower the price so much
for so long. And, as marketing legend Rory Sutherland says, “Any
fool can sell something for less.”
 
So, to build goodwill to get referrals, the question isn’ t how do we
lower our price but, how do we give more value?
 
 
Six W ays T o Get Mor e Referrals By Giving  Mor e V alue
 

There are six ways I get referrals by giving more value. And it just
so happens to map to the parts of an ad. Neat-o.
 
1 . Call Outs → Sell Better Customers
 
2 . Dream Outcome → Set Better Expectations
 
3 . Increase Perceived Likelihood of Achievement → Get More
People Better Results
 
4 . Decrease T ime Delay → Get Faster Results
 
5 . Decrease Ef fort and Sacrifice → Keep Making Y our Stuf f Better
 
6 . Call to Action → T ell Them What T o Buy Next
 
 
1 . Call outs → Sell Better Customers.  W e want to sell better customers
because they get the most value from our products. Customers that get
the most value have the most goodwill.  And the customers that have
the most goodwill are most likely to refer . Y es, it’ s that simple. Let me
give you a real-life example:
 
W e have a portfolio company that did public relations for generic
small businesses. They had a lot of sales, but they had a lot of churn.
So they plateaued. They didn’ t grow for years.

 
T o see what we could do, we looked at their lowest churning
customers to see if they had anything in common - they did. They
were all in a specific niche and looking to raise funding from
investors. So the solution looked obvious–get more of them! But the
founder had a big worry–these customers were only fifteen percent of
his business. If he changed his tar geting, and it failed, he would lose
eighty-five percent of his business(!). But the business wasn’ t growing
anyway . A tough situation for any entrepreneur . But, after reviewing
the data many times, he agreed to change the advertising call outs to
match this narr ower , “perfect fit” customer .
 
The results: The company broke through its plateau. They grew for
the first time in years - and now on track to adding millions per
month . Plus, their cost of advertising–a huge expense for their
stagnating business–went down. They got even cheaper leads  since
they could be more specific with their messaging. But not only that,
the cheaper leads got even more value from the product because it was
meant for them . And those customers, because they had more
goodwill toward the business, started referring like clockwork.
 
Action Step:  Incr ease the quality of the pr ospect, and you’ll incr ease
the quality of the pr oduct.  Figure out what your most successful
customers have in common. Use those similarities to tar get a new
audience that has the greatest chance of getting the most value. Then,
sell only  people who meet those new criteria. Set yourself up to build
more goodwill. More goodwill means more referrals.


 
2 . Dr eam Outcome→Set Better Expectations:  The fastest, easiest, and
cheapest way to make your product remarkable - make it better than
they expect. And that's easier than you might think because you  set the
expectations.
 
 
Have you ever had a stranger tell you a new movie was awesome?
Then you go see it and think ‘that wasn’ t as good as I expected.’ On
the flip side, have you ever had someone tell you a movie was terrible,
then you ended up seeing it anyways and thought ‘That wasn’ t as bad
as I expected.’ Our expectations of an experience can dramatically
af fect the experience itself. W e can increase goodwill by lowering
expectations. It gives us room to overdeliver .
 
In the beginning, I promised everything and the kitchen sink to get
people to buy . Fulfilling on that turned into a nightmare. So, I began
inching down my promises while maintaining quality . It gave me
more room to overdeliver and I netted a major benefit - referrals.
Customer expectations are fickle. That’ s why we set the expectations
for them. And if we set those expectations, then we can exceed them.
 
Action Step:  Slowly lower the promises you make when making
of fers. Keep lowering them until your close rates lower . At that point,
stop. This maximizes how many customers you get and  the goodwill
you build with them. Maximized customers and more goodwill means
more referrals.

 
 
3 . Incr ease Per ceived Likelihood of Achievement → Get Mor e
People Better Results:
The customers with the best results get the most value from your
product. Figure out what they do to get the most value, and you can
help your other customers do the same. T wo steps ago, to sell better
customers, we figured out who the best ones wer e . So now , to get
everyone the best results, we figure out what the best ones did .
 
Let me show you what it looked like at Gym Launch. W e started by
tracking customer activities. Speed to running their first paid ad.
Speed to their first sale. Their attendance on calls. Etc. Then, we
compared the activities of our average  customers to the activities of
our best  customers. W e found out something huge. If a gym owner ran
paid ads and made a sale in the first seven days, their L TGP tripled .
Once we realized this, we focused on getting everyone  to launch ads
and make sales in the first seven days. The results of our average
customers skyrocketed. More customers, more testimonials and more
referrals followed.
 
Here’ s the process I use to get more people better results:
 

Step #1: Survey customers to find the ones who got the best results.
 
Step #2: Interview them to find out what they did dif ferently .
 
Step #3: Look at the actions  they had in common.
 
Step #4: Force new customers to repeat the actions that got the best
results.
 
Step #5: Measure the improvement in average customer results (speed
and outcome)
 
Step #6: Match the conditions of your guarantee to the actions that
get the best results to get more people to do them.
 
 
 
Action Steps:  Figure out what the best people did. Then get everyone
to do it. Make your guarantees around the actions that create the most
success. More success. More goodwill. More referrals.

 
4 . Decr ease T ime Delay→Make Faster W ins:  I define a “win” as any
positive experience a customer has. Faster wins increase their
perception of speed, increase the likelihood they’ll stick, and increase
how much they trust you. T riple win. T o make wins feel  faster , we
give them wins mor e often . 
 
Let’ s imagine you have a product that takes a week to deliver . The
customer can get one win at the end of that week or win every day
with daily progress updates. Same amount of progress, seven times
the wins. On top of that, if someone said seven things would happen,
and all seven do, I trust them even more. Referring a friend is now
lower risk since seven promises were made, and all seven were kept.
 
Here’ s five ways I make wins happen faster in the real world:
 
1 . If I have seven small things to deliver , I deliver them at
shorter intervals rather than all at once. 
 
2 . Updates are wins. If it’ s a bigger project, I share progress
updates as frequently as possible. Y ou can never give
someone too much good news. And regular updates, progress
or not, is better than leaving your customers hanging.
 
3 . Customers form their lasting impression of a business within
the first forty-eight hours after they buy . Force a good

impression. Force as many wins as you can in that window .
Set many expectations. Meet many expectations. Repeat. 
 
4 . They should always know the next time they’ll hear from
you. I got a slick saying from a public CEO friend of mine -
BAMF AM: Book-A-Meeting-From-A-Meeting. Again, never
leave a customer in no man’ s land. They should always know
what happens… next . 
 
5 . Never expect customers to for give you. Ever . So act like it.
For example, you can deliver early , but never late. I add fifty
percent to my timelines so I always deliver early . That makes
“on time” for me early  for them. 
 
Action step:  Break down outcomes into the smallest possible
increment. Communicate as often as reasonable (even if there is no
progress, update them). Set timelines with breathing room. Deliver
early . More customer wins means more goodwill. And more goodwill
means more referrals.
 
 
5 . Decr ease Effort & Sacrifice → Keep Making Y our Stuff Better:  If
the customer does less stuf f they hate to benefit from your product,
you’ve made it better . If the customer gives up fewer things they love
to benefit from your product, you’ve made it better . And there’ s no
such thing as a perfect product. Y ou can always  make it better . And
the easier you make it for them to benefit, the more goodwill you get,
and the more likely they’ll refer . Here’ s my process to keep making
my stuf f better .
 

Step #1: Use customer service data, surveys, and reviews to find
the most common problem with your product.
 
Step #2: Figure out your fix. T o get a headstart, get feedback from
the customers who made your product work for them
despite the problem it has.
 
Step #3: Use that feedback to improve your product.
 
Step #4: Give the new version to a small group of your (struggling)
customers.
 
Step #5: Get your next round of feedback. If you solved the
original problem, then roll it out to all customers. If it
didn’ t, go back to step #2.
 
Step #6: Move to the next most common problem and repeat the
process. Do this until the end of time.
 
Action Step:  Keep making your stuf f better . Survey . Make changes.
Implement. Measure. Repeat. I run this process every month. Set this
as a recurring monthly process. A product that takes less ef fort and
fewer sacrifices means more goodwill. And more goodwill means
more referrals.
 
 
6. Call T o Action→ T ell Them What T o Buy Next:  If you have an
amazing product, they’ll want more. Y ou have to satisfy their desire to
buy . If you don’ t, they’ll still buy… but fr om someone else . Don’ t let

that happen. Sell them again. Y ou can either sell them a new thing or
more of the thing they just bought. In either case, you’ll get even
more goodwill and extend the lifetime of the customer . And besides,
the more stuf f they can buy , the more stuf f they can refer their friends
to.
 
For example, in a weight loss company we know , lots of customers
referred friends to their first tier product. But, some didn't. A lot of
those customers who didn't refer to the first product, when they
bought their more expensive thing, referred their friends to that! So
you gotta keep selling.
 
In my experience, people obsess over their front end of fers. And that
makes sense. But then they neglect the back end and customers fall
off . And customers that fall of f your product are unlikely to refer - so
keep selling them so they don’ t.
 
Action Step:  T reat every customer like it's the first time you've sold
them. Make sure your next of fer is more compelling than your first.
Remind them to buy more after each big win. More things to buy
means more opportunities to add even more value. More value means
more goodwill. And more goodwill means, you guessed it, more
referrals.
 
 
One Question to Rule Them All
 
Let’ s consolidate these six steps into one thought experiment. I
encourage you to try it out with your team. Here it is:
 
Y ou’ve lost all your customers but one. The gods of advertising ban
you fr om doing the cor e four and decr ee:
 

-All customers must come fr om this one customer .
 
-V iolate our terms and we will destr oy your business, and every
other business you start, for eternity .
 
T ough break. But, the question remains, how would you treat this
customer?  What would you do to make their experience so
valuable  they  would  send all their friends? What kind of results
would they need to get? What would their onboarding be? What
type of customer would you pick? Think about it. W rite it out. Y our
business depends on it. Then… do it :)
 
Start acting like the advertising gods will revoke your core four
privileges at any moment. Soon you’ll see you have no choice but
to start adding more value to get more customer referrals.
 
Now that we covered that. Do you wanna know how you can get
even mor e  referrals? →Ask for them.
 
 
Referrals: Ask For Them
 
Do you know why businesses have so few referrals compared to
what they could have? They never ask for them. Y our customers,
like any audience, can only know what to do if you tell them.
 
Now , I’ve tried a lot  of referral strategies. Most failed. And I
struggled until I had this epiphany: Asking for referrals only works
when you treat it like an of fer .  The r eferrals come when you show
the value the customer gets when they r efer their friends.  Let me
give you two quick case studies to show the power of asking for
referrals:

 
Case Study #1 : Dropbox gave free storage to customers and free
storage to  the friends they referred. The referral program went viral
and they 39 x'd their business in fifteen months.
 
 
Case Study #2 : Paypal gave $10 in credit to customers and  $10 to
the friends they referred. W ithin two years, the program helped
them reach a million users, and six years later , they hit 100 million
users. They still use it today .
 
So how do we harness the same viral growth in our own small
businesses? W e do what they did. W e ask for it.
 
Seven W ays T o Ask  For Referrals
 
There are three components to a referral program: how you give
the incentive, what you incentivize with, and how you ask. Rather
than give you a hundred variations that may or may not work, here
are the seven combos that worked best for me:
 
1)  One-Sided Referral Benefit : I’d rather pay customers than a
platform any day of the week. Pay your average cost to acquire a
customer (CAC) to the referrer or the friend. Make them aware of

the incentive.
 
Ex: Imagine it costs $200 to get a new customer . Ask the current
customer to make an actual three-way introduction to a friend–via
call, SMS, or email. Not just a name and number . Also, ask them to
do it right when they buy…don’ t wait. Then, write them a check
for $200 when their friend signs up OR  give their friend $200 of f.
 
Ex: This works great for spouses because they both basically get
the benefit. Always ask for the spouse & give a household
discount.
 
2)  T wo-Sided Referral Benefits : This is what Dropbox and PayPal
used. W e pay our CAC to both parties. Half goes to the referrer (in
credit or cash) and half goes to the friend (in credit). This way , they
both  benefit.
 
Ex: W e sell $500 programs. Our cost to get a customer is $200. For
every friend someone refers, we give them $100 cash, and give
their friend $100 of f signing up. Good for up to 3 friends. This
worked really well for my local businesses.
 


 
3) Ask For A Referral Right When They Buy:  On the sales contract or
checkout page, ask for some names and phone numbers of people
they’d like to do this with . Show them how they  will get better
results when they do it with a friend.
 
Ex: I had a new salesman come into one of my portfolio companies
and shatter all the sales records for an upcoming event. W e didn’ t
know what was going on. So I hopped on the phone with him - how
ar e you selling mor e tickets than everyone else ? He shrugged and
said, “I’m doing the same thing as everyone else. I just make sure I
ask them who else they’d want to have come with them. Then ask
them to introduce me.” Half  his sales were referrals. So simple, and
yet no one does it .
 
Scripting example: People who do our pr ogram with someone else
tend to get 3x the r esults. Who else could you do this pr ogram
with?
 
 
4) Add Referrals As A Negotiation Chip : On top of that, you can ask
for referrals as a way to negotiate a lower price. In other words, if
someone wants to pay $400 and your price is $500, you can give
them the discount in exchange for  an introduction to three friends.
Y ou can ethically char ge a dif ferent price for the same thing
because you changed the terms of the sale.
 

Ex: “I can’ t do anything less than $500 down, but if you make a 3-
way text introduction to a few of your friends right now , I’d be
happy to cut that initiation fee.”
 
And to address the question you didn’ t ask - if a full-priced
customer finds out you gave someone else a discount (which I’ve
had happen), here’ s all you say: “Y ea - Stacy got $100 off because
she r eferr ed thr ee friends. I'm happy to give you $100 if you r efer
me thr ee friends. Who do you have in mind?”  They either back of f
or they give you three friends. W in win.
 
5) Referral Events:  Where people get points, credits, dollars or even
just bragging rights for bringing friends within an explicit time
period. Referral events typically last from one to four weeks.
Whenever you run one of these events, sell everyone on the
benefits of working with others. Use some stats (internal or
external) to show high success rates and the selfish benefit to
bringing friends. I use names like:
 
“Bring-a-friend” Promotion
 
“Spouse Challenge” Promotion
 
“Accountability Buddy” Promotion
 
“Coach Challenge” Promotion where you create teams with
your employees and customers. This works well in coaching
style businesses.
 
6) Ongoing Referral Programs : Instead of running a limited duration
referral promotion, you talk about the benefits of doing things with
others all the time. Think: in your free content, outreach, paid ads,
etc. After a buddy did this, he saw a 33% boost in total  sign ups.

For context, he had 1,000,000 customers buy tickets to his virtual
event and 250,000 of them were referred…this stuf f works.
 
7) Unlockable Referral Bonuses : Create bonuses for people who 1)
refer and 2) leave a testimonial. A few examples: Unlock VIP
bonuses, courses, tokens, status, training, merchandise, service
levels, premium support, additional hours of service, etc. 
 
Unlockable referral bonuses work well if you don’ t like paying out
cash. The bonuses can also be for both  parties if you like (since
they cost you less than cash). V isit the lead magnet section for
some extra inspiration. As always, the more insane you make the
of fer , the more people will refer . If you want them to refer , make it
so good they’d be stupid not to.
 
 
Y ou’r e Only Limited By Y our Cr eativity
 
Here’ s what it looks like to combine a few of the strategies above
into a killer referral promotion.
 
Give everyone a gift card for one-third the cost of their program.
T ell them they can give it to a friend of theirs if they sign up with
them. Give the gift card an expiration date within seven to fourteen
days from the date you give it to them→it’ll force them to use it.
This gives the referrer status when they give it to their friend.
Rather than saying “hey join my program for $2000 of f” they say ,
“I got this gift card for $2000. Do you want it? I don’ t want to
waste it.” It’ s seen as a much bigger deal for them and you.
 
Y ou can still use the three-way introduction with this tactic. Then
text a picture of the gift card. Bonus points if you write the friend’ s
name on it before texting the picture. It makes it feel personalized

and gives you a legitimate reason for asking for their friend’ s name
(wink).
 
PS - Y ou can also sell the gift cards at ninety percent of f as
purchasable gifts (only for friends of customers). The referrer
looks like they spent a lot of money , and you get paid to get new
customers.  I can hardly think of a better way to make money .
Again, the only limit is your creativity .
 
 
 
Conclusion
 
Referrals aren’ t an advertising method you can “do.”  It’ s not one
trick or hack (although we learned some of those). It’ s a  way of

doing business . And it starts with you .
 
After all, referring is always a risk for the customer . They risk their
goodwill with their friend in the hopes  of getting more by showing
them something cool (your stuf f). So customers only  refer when
they think it’ s very likely their friend will have a good experience.
In other words, when the benefits to them personally outweigh the
risk of hurting the relationship with their friend. So we add benefits
for them and their friends with incentives and we lower the risk by
building goodwill (showing we deliver on our promises). And we
do that by using the six ways to give your customers more value.
Now don’ t get me wrong, building goodwill does a fantastic job of
getting referrals on its own. But if we’re smart, which we are, we
capitalize on that goodwill, so we can get even more referrals, by
using the seven ways to ask for them. Whew!
 
So give more than you get and you’ll never go hungry again. This
is how we tr eat our customers . Do this, and you can monetize
goodwill  forever . T o keep this in perspective, I always remind
myself: I am compensated tomorr ow for the value I pr ovide today .
 
 
Action Items
 
Figure out your referral percentages and churn percentages to set a
baseline. Implement the six “giving value” steps to build goodwill.
Then capitalize on that goodwill, using one or more of the seven
ways to ask for referrals.
 
 
Next Up…
 

So now we have to figure out how to scale a team. It looks like
we’ll have to call out potential teammates, show them the value of
joining the team, then ask them to join. W ait… that sounds
familiar . But seriously , if you really want a $100M leads machine,
buckle up. The most valuable chapter in the book is coming up
next - employees . For real, this isn’ t a boring chapter , and you’re
gonna need them if you wanna make the big money .
