How T o Reach Out T o Strangers T o Get Engaged Leads
 
“Quantity has a quality all of its own” - Napoleon Bonaparte
 
 
July 2020.
 
COVID-19 raged. In a matter of months, thirty percent of my
customers went out of business. Protestors filled every platform
with hate and anger . Politicians made promises. Small businesses
suf fered in silence. Unemployment skyrocketed. The most
tumultuous election ever was upon us. And here we were, trying to
generate leads to pay our bills. Employees everywhere, and their
families, depended on it.
 
All three of my companies at the time (Gym Launch, Prestige
Labs, and ALAN) relied on brick-and-mortar businesses staying
open. And, they were closed. Brilliant strategy Alex . T o make

matters worse, Apple did a software update that crippled our ads.
The market was crap. Our paid ads were crap. And I carried the
bucket.
 
I ran through worst-case scenarios. How much cash would it take
to keep us afloat? How long do I keep paying people when ther e’ s
no end in sight? Should I dip into personal accounts? Give up a
thir d of my life savings? Half? All of it? What does that say about
me?  I had no idea what to do.
 
Early that Satur day morning…
 
I tried to sleep long enough for my alarm to wake me, but it was no
use. I went to my of fice and checked Instagram. I had a new
message waiting for me:
 
“Hey Alex - Cale told me you guys don’ t need salesmen anymor e,
so my offer got pulled. I quit my job to accept it. Super honor ed
you consider ed me. I hope you’ll consider me again the next time
you have openings.”
 
Looking for context, I scrolled up. Reading our earlier messages
rewarded me with a pang of guilt. I was the one who told him to
apply . He took the rejection well. A sign of a good salesman . I felt
obligated to reply .
 
“Y ou on?” I messaged.
 
“Y es,” he replied.
 
“Got 5?”

 
“Y es”
 
W e hopped on a call. He sounded a little nervous, but I could tell
he knew his stuf f. It sucks we don’ t have enough leads for this
guy…
 
“I’ve wanted to work for you a while now . I read your book and
used the scripts to become the top producer at my company ,” he
said.
 
“That’ s awesome. I’m so glad to hear it. What kind of company?” I
asked.
 
“A gym software company .”
 
I hadn’ t hear d of them . “Oh interesting. How do you guys get
leads?”
 
“W e’re 100% cold outreach.”
 
“Y ou cold call and cold email gyms, then sell them software?”
 
“Y ea, pretty much.”
 
“How big is the team?”
 
“W e’ve got about thirty guys.”
 

A team of 30!?  “What’ s your revenue like if you can share that
with me.”
 
“W e’re doing about $10,000,000 per month now .”
 
Insane.  “Just from cold outreach?”
 
“Y ea, we run some ads, but we haven’ t cracked that yet.”
 
“And you do this with a retention of fer? Y ou’re not even really
making gyms more money?”
 
“Y ea, it's definitely not as easy to sell as the stuf f you do for
gyms.”
 
“Do you think you could use the same cold outreach system here?”
 
“I’ve never started a team, but I bet I could figure it out.”
 
“Alright. What was the of fer Cale pulled?”
 
“I was gonna be a closer , but he said you guys didn't need one
anymore.”
 
I thought for a moment. “W ell, given our current lead volume, he’ s
probably right. But, if you can get your own leads , I’ll give you the
runway to get cold outreach going. What do you think?”
 
“It takes a while to get going. I’ll have to figure out the scripts for
your of fer .”

 
“Y eah, that makes sense. How long, you think?”
 
“I’m confident I could make it profitable in twelve weeks.”
 
“Alright, deal. I’ll let Cale know the plan. T o be clear , you’ll be
expected to figure all this out. The software. The lists. Everything.
I’ll front you the time, but we can’ t support you much beyond
that.”
 
“Understood.”
 
Here’ s what happened during the months that followed:
 
September: 0 Sales. Zippola. Nothin’. Zilch. Nada.
 
October: 2 Sales ($32,000 in revenue) T eam asks me to pull the
plug on cold outreach.
 
December: 4 Sales ($64,000 in revenue) T eam asks me to pull the
plug, again.
 
January: 6 Sales ($96,000 in revenue)
 
February: 10 Sales ($160,000 in revenue)
 
March: 14 Sales ($224,000 in revenue)
 
April: 20 Sales ($320,000 in revenue)

 
May: 30 Sales ($480,000 in revenue)
 
T oday: Cold outreach generates millions per month for our
businesses
 
Making this work took every (legal) cold outreach method we
knew . Cold calls….Cold emails….Cold Direct
Messages….V oicemails. Everything. But, piece by piece, we built
a reliable customer -getting machine. I wanted something that
would endur e .
 
And that’ s what I’m gonna show you how to build.
 
 
I learned five important lessons fr om this experience:
 
1) There was another company in my space making a lot  more
money than mine. It broke my belief about how big the market
really was.
 
2) They made all their money through private  advertising. I had no
way of knowing they existed unless they contacted me first. So,
they kind of operated in secret.
 
3) They built a very profitable cold outreach machine in my  space.
If they could do it, so could I.
 
4) It’ s good to have proper expectations. Cold outreach veterans
told me it would take a year to scale. I figured we could do it in
twelve weeks. I was wrong. It took almost a year . Cold outreach

takes a long time. At least, it did for me.
 
5) W e tried cold outreach two times before and failed. W orking
with a person that had done it all before was immensely helpful in
getting this going. I hope to be that person for you now .
 
 
How Cold Outr each W orks
 
 
At some point, you’ll want one of two things. Either , you’ll want to
grow faster than you currently are. Or , you’ll want to increase the
predictability of your lead flow…
 
Here’ s how we can do that. W e advertise to people who don’ t
know us. Cold audiences. And like before, we can contact them
publicly or privately . In this chapter , we focus on private one-to-
one communication with cold outreach. For added context, cold
outreach sits atop the foundation of warm outreach. So think of this
as the more advanced cousin of warm outreach, no longer limited
by your warm audience.
 
If you can figure out a way to contact somebody one-to-one, you
can use it for cold outreach. Y ou knock on 100 doors. Y ou make
100 phone calls. Y ou send 100 direct messages. Y ou send 100
voicemails. All these are examples of cold outreach that have made

companies zillions. It worked 100 years ago. It works today . And
when the platforms change, it’ll work tomorrow .
 
Cold outreach has one key dif ference from warm outreach: trust.
Strangers don’ t trust you.
 
And compared to people who know us, strangers present three  new
problems.
 
1)  First, you don't have a way to contact them. Duh.
 
2)  Second, even if you can contact them, they ignore you. 
 
3)  Third, even if they give you their attention, they’re not
interested.
 
 
Let me describe what these problems look like in the real world.
 
If you’re knocking on doors , you don't have the addresses. Then,
even if you do, they don't open the door when you knock. If they
open, they still tell you to pound sand.
 
If you’re making cold calls , you don't have their phone numbers.
Even if you do, they don't pick up. If they pick up, they hang up on
you.
 
If you're sending cold emails , you don’ t have their email addresses.
Even if you do, they don’ t open the email. Even if they do, they
don’ t respond.
 

If you’re sending direct messages , you don’ t have a place to send
it. Even if you do, they don’ t read it. Even if they read it, they
don’ t reply .
 
If you’re sending voice memos or text messages , you don’ t have
their numbers. Even if you do, they don’ t read or listen to it. Even
if they read or listen to it, they don’ t reply .
 
Now that we got that out of the way , the order we solve these
problems is:
 
1)  Get a way to contact them
 
2)  Figure out what to say
 
3)  Contact them until they’re ready and able to listen 
 
The Result . W e find lots of ways to contact the most qualified
strangers. W e reach out to a lot of them in a lot of ways a lot of
times. Then, we overwhelm them with value upfront to get them to
show enough interest to move forward.
 

 
Cold outreach is a numbers game. The more people you reach out
to the more engaged leads you get. Once we figure out how much
outreach it takes to engage a lead, then we only have one thing to
do… mor e . Let’ s go hunting!
 
As there are three new problems strangers introduce, I’ve divided
this chapter into three steps. One step per problem. First, we get a
tar geted list of leads. Next, we need to know what to say to get
them to reply . Third, we make up for a lower response rate by
increasing the volume and type of our reach out attempts.
 
 
Pr oblem #1: “But how do I contact them?”  →Build a List
 

 
Up until this point, from warm reach outs and posting free content,
you’ve had to accept the leads that came to you from your warm
audience. No more. W ith cold outreach, unlike any other way of
advertising, we get to be as specific as we want. Only want to talk
to hedge fund managers managing over $1B? Done. Y ou can do
that. Only want to speak with golf apparel retail store owners over
$3M in sales? Done. Only want to talk to influencers who get over
50,000 unique page views per month? Done. Now we  get to pick
our tar gets rather than them picking us.
 
Now , you probably don’ t have a way to reach out to 1000 perfect
fit strangers. And if we’re gonna get them to buy from us, we’ve
gotta first find a way to contact them– duh . So let’ s solve that
problem first.
 
There are three dif ferent ways I get my tar geted lead lists. First, I
use software to scrape a list of names. Second, I pay brokers to
assemble me a list of tar geted leads. And if neither of those work, I
manually scrape a list of names myself. Here’ s the process.
 
Step #1 Softwares : I subscribe to as many softwares as I can that
scrape leads from dif ferent sources. I search them all based on
my criteria. The software then spits out names, job titles, contact
information, etc. I try out a representative sample, say a few
hundred from each software I use. Then, if the contact
information is up to date, the leads are responsive, and they are
the type of person the software claims them to be, bingo! Then I

get as many leads as the software will give me. But if I can’ t
seem to find the right audience, I move onto step two.
 
Step #2 Brokers : I go to multiple list brokers and ask them to
make me a list based on my audience criteria. They then send
me a sample. I test out sample lists from each of the brokers. If I
get good results from one or more brokers, I stick with their
lists. And if I still can’ t find who I’m looking for , I move to step
three.
 
Step #3 Elbow Grease : I join groups and communities that I
think have my audience. When I find people that meet my
qualifications, I check to see if they have ways to contact them
in the group’ s directory–like links to their social media profiles,
etc.  If they do, I add them to my list. If they don’ t, I can reach
out to them within the platform hosting the group. I prefer to
find contact information outside the group so I don’ t come of f as
someone solely trying to milk the group for business but I will if
I have to .
 
So I work my way from the most accessible leads to the least
accessible leads. Here’ s an important point. If you can search the
database, so can everyone else. But if you assemble a list of names
yourself, it’ s less likely that person has already received many cold
reach outs from other companies. So they’re the freshest.
Downside: it takes the most time. Of course, you can pay someone
else to do this for you once you figure it out for yourself, but we’re
only talking about getting started in this chapter . W e’ll talk about
scaling in Section IV .
 
Action Step:  Find your scraping tool by searching “outbound
leads scraping tool” or “database lead scraping.” Find brokers the
same way . W ith a few clicks, you’ll find what you’re looking for .
Put your first 1000 names together . If you have more time than

money , you might want to start at step three since it only costs
time.
 
 
Pr oblem #2: “I have my list, but what do I say to them?”
→Personalize, Then Give Big Fast V alue
 
Now that you have your list of leads, you gotta figure out what to
say .  I went over a lot of scripting in the W arm Reach Outs section–
this section builds on that one. At the end of this chapter , I also
include three sample scripts you can model for cold calls, cold
emails, and cold chat messaging. That being said, there are two
important factors I emphasize to get strangers to engage:
personalization  and big fast value . This is important because they
don't know us and they don’ t trust us. W e’ve gotta overcome both
issues in a matter of seconds.
 
a) They Don’t Know Us→Personalize (Act Like Y ou Know Them).
T o get more leads to engage, we want the message to look  like it’ s
from someone they know . The best way to do that is to actually know
something about the person you are contacting. In essence, we want
our cold  reach out to look like a warm  reach out.
 
…Imagine your phone rings from an unknown number and area code.
Are you likely to pick it up? Probably not. What about if the number

is from your area code? A little more likely . Why is that? Because it
might be someone you know . So to take this concept further , imagine
you pick up the phone...
 
…The person says “<Y our name?>” then pausing (like a normal
person). Y ou’d say , “yea…who’ s this?” Now , if that person then went
on to say , “it’ s Alex… then pauses …I watched a few of your videos
and read that recent blog post you wrote on dog training. It was killer!
Really helped me out with my doberman. She’ s a beast! That peanut
butter trick really helped. Thanks for that.”
 
Y ou’d still be wondering what’ s going on. But you know what you
wouldn’ t be doing?… hanging up . Then you hear , “Oh yea, sorry , I got
ahead of myself. I work for a company that helps dog trainers fill up
their books. W e like to partner with the best in the area. So I’m always
on the lookout. W e worked with someone about an hour north from
you…John’ s Doggy Daycare…heard of them?”
 
Y ou’d respond yes or no (it doesn’ t matter), and they’d say , “Y ea, we
ended up getting them 100 appointments in 30 days using a
combination of text email and some ads. Do you of fer similar services
to them?” T o which you’d probably say yes. Then they’d say , “Oh
that’ s perfect. Then we’d be able to use that same campaign in your
market and drive leads over to you. If you got a boatload of high
paying new dog training customers you wouldn’ t be upset with me
would you?” Y ou’d laugh lightly . “Okay great. W ell…tell ya what…I
can walk you through the entire thing soup to nuts later today . W ill
you be around at 4?” And you’d say - sure - or whatever . The point is,
if that person had started the call with “hey man, wanna buy some
marketing services?” you’d probably have hung up.
 
Personalization  is what gets your foot in the door to get the sale.
Basically one to three pieces of information we can find that a friend
might know about the prospect. Then we want to complement them on

it, and ideally , show them how it benefited us. People like people who
like them. Even if someone doesn’ t know you, they’ll give you more
time if you know something about them.
 
This comes in handy for personal subject lines on emails, the first few
messages in chat, or the first few sentences someone hears. Even if
someone doesn’ t know you, they will appreciate the time you took to
research them before contacting them. This tiny ef fort goes a long
way .
 
Action step: Do a little research on each lead before you send
them a message. W e can do this ourselves, pay people to do it for
us, or use software. Batch this work. Then, use your notes to figure
out the first thing you’ll open with to feel mor e familiar .
 
 
b) They Don’t T rust Us→Big Fast V alue.  The key dif ference between
people who know you and strangers is…strangers give you far less
time to prove your worth. And, they need a lot more incentive to
move towards you. So make your life easier by “giving away the
farm.” W e’re not trying to tickle their interest, we’re trying to blow
their minds in under thirty seconds .

 
Like warm reach outs, you can directly make your of fer , or of fer a
lead magnet, or both. It gives the person a strong reason to respond.
 
I specifically call out ‘big fast value’ rather than “your lead magnet”
as a reminder that it needs to be BIG F AST V ALUE. If it’ s not, or it’ s
mediocre, you’ll blend in with the ocean of people trying to get their
attention. And they’ll treat you the same–they’ll ignore you. Here’ s
how much it matters:
 
The first four months of cold outreach felt like torture. W e of fered a
game planning session as our lead magnet. Some gyms took us up on
it, but most didn’ t. W e needed something better . I tested many parts of
our process but swapping the lead magnet blew everything else out of
the water . W e swapped from “game planning” - code for “sales call” - 
to actually giving them as much free service as we could possibly
af ford. Our take rates 3x’d and cold outreach became a monster
channel for us.
 
If your of fer/lead magnet isn’ t working for you, up the ante. Keep
of fering more until you make it so good they feel stupid saying no .
They either buy from you or have nice things to say about you. W in-
win.
 
If you for get everything about this chapter , remember one thing: the
goal is to  demonstrate big value as fast as possible .  Give yourself a
downhill battle by giving away something crazy . Give away
something for free people would normally pay for and they will want
it. Note: I didn’ t say , “so good they should pay for it,” I said, “stuf f
they actually pay for .” Big dif ference. T ake this to heart and your
results will show it.
 

Action Step: Provide the biggest fastest value  you can af ford to
with your lead magnet or of fer . Then, write your scripts. And don’ t
worry , I got your back there. T o give you a headstart, I provide
sample phone, email, and direct message scripts at the end of the
chapter . Note: Phone and chat scripts are never more than a page or
two, and cold emails rarely more than half a page. So don’ t
overthink it. There are no awards for prettiest script. Get your first
100 conversations or 10,000 emails out of the way before tweaking
it. Get testing. Then tweak as you learn.
 
 
Pr oblem #3: “I’m not getting enough chances to tell people
about my amazing stuff, what do I do?”  → V olume
 
Once we have our list of names, personal info, and our big sexy
lead magnet, we need to get more strangers to see it. W e do this in
three ways. First, we automate delivery to the greatest extent
possible. Next, we automate distribution to the greatest extent
possible. Finally , we follow up more times in more ways.
 
a) Automated Delivery .  T o the extent that we can, automating delivery
unlocks huge scale as someone doesn’ t need to literally communicate
the message to the prospect. This means you get more engaged leads
per unit of time (even if fewer engage by overall percentage).
Remember , you have far more people who don’ t know you than
people who do. So you don’ t have to worry as much  about ‘burning
through an audience.’ Here’ s what the dif ference between manual and
automated delivery looks like.
 
 

Manual Examples : A live person can say a script to someone over the
phone. Y ou can send a personal voice memo to each lead. A person
can write a handwritten letter to every person on the list. If it takes a
person time to convey the message each time, it’ s manual.
 
 
Automated Examples : W e can send a pre-recorded voice memo to
someone’ s direct messages. W e can send a pre-recorded voicemail to
someone’ s voicemail box. W e can send templated emails to an inbox
or a templated text to someone’ s phone. W e can send a pre-recorded
video. Etc. Y ou record your message one time and then send the same
message to everyone.
 
 
b) Automate Distribution . Once we have our messages prepared, we
gotta distribute them. And there’ s no award for who works the
hardest, only for who gets the best results. Although one leads to the

other . And as you build your skills, you will find ways to automate
portions of the work. I encourage you to automate when ethical and
available.
 
 
Manual examples : Dial each phone number . Click send on each email,
direct message, text, etc.
Automated examples : Use a robot to dial multiple numbers at a time.
Send a blast of 1000 emails, texts, voicemails at one time. Etc.
 
Generally speaking, you sacrifice personalization for scale. Y ou get
a higher response rate with personalized messages. The fewer leads
you have, the less automation you should use.
 
For example, if there are only 1000 hedge fund managers who
meet your criteria, you’re gonna wanna personalize every one of
them. On the other hand, if you’re tar geting women 25-45 trying to
lose weight, there are tens of millions of them. So you can get
away with less personalization. But…if you personalize…you’ll
get even more (wink).
 

 
Action Step. Embrace new technology . Allocate ten to twenty
percent of your ef fort towards brand new untested technology . For
example, if you make phone calls five days per week, try out a new
dialer or tech one of the days and see how it does compared to your
standard dialer .
 
c) Follow up. Mor e times. Mor e ways.  There are two more ways you
can get more from your list of names.
 
 
First, you try to contact them more than once. Shocker . But wanna
know something crazy , most people don’ t. Here’ s a dif ferent way to
think about it. Imagine you really needed to get a hold of your parents
because something important came up. What would you do? Y ou’d
probably call them, text them, leave a voicemail, etc. And if they still

haven’ t responded, what would you do? Y ou'd call and text them
again (probably shortly thereafter). It's the same way with prospects.
They are in danger of living life without your solution. Be a hero.
Save them!
 
The more ways you try to contact someone, the more likely you are to
contact them. People respond to dif ferent methods. For example, I
never respond to phone calls. But, I reply to direct messages far more.
 
Contacting someone multiple times multiple ways shows them you
are serious. And doing so quickly communicates you have something
important to discuss. Curiosity increases because they fear they're
missing out.
 
Personally , I like to email first. Y ou know why? Because most people
don’ t respond. If someone doesn’ t respond to one of your reach out
methods, use that as a reason to follow up with another method. “Hey
I’m calling you to follow up about my email.”  W e either get a
response or a real reason to reach out again. W e win either way .
 
And once you do get them booked for an appointment, expect more
than one conversation. Remember ,  we’re contacting complete
strangers. Outreach takes more touch points with people who don’ t
know you. So expect two to three conversations before a higher ticket
sale. Shoot for less, but expect more when you start out.
 
Bottom line : Act like you’re actually  trying to get ahold of these
people, rather than going through the motions, and you probably
will.
 
Action Step: Contact each lead multiple times in multiple ways.
 

 
Second, once you finish contacting your list, start back at the top
again. This actually works for three reasons .
 
One, because they simply may not have seen your first series of
messages. Only a fool would think one hundred percent of people
see what you put out one hundred percent of the time. So we make
up for that discrepancy with follow up.
 
T wo, even if they do see it, it may not have been a good moment to
respond.  People's schedules change every day . And there are times
when people can’ t respond to you even if they wanted to. So the
more opportunities you give them to respond, the greater the
chance they will.
 
Three, their circumstances may have changed. They might not
have needed you then, but need you desperately now . Imagine a
person you message about losing weight before the holidays. At
that time, they fit into their ‘skinny’ jeans, so they feel no pain.
They probably wouldn’ t respond. But after they gained ten lbs over
the holidays, they may all of a sudden be in desperate need of what
you of fer . And now , they respond to your reach out attempt. The

only thing that changed was their circumstance. So try again in
three to six months and get an entirely new group of engaged leads
fr om the same list .
 
Everything may be right except the timing. So the more times we
contact them, the more likely we will catch them at the time
they’re ready to engage.
 
Action Step. After you’ve attempted to contact them multiple
times, multiple ways, wait three to six months. Then, do it again.
 
 
 
Thr ee Pr oblems Strangers Cr eate→Solved
 
I wrote the book in this order to build on itself. Start with warm
reach outs. Get some reps. Post some content to grow your warm
audience. Get even more reps. Then, you’ll be ready for cold reach
outs.
 

And now , we solved the three core problems cold audiences create:
finding the right list of people, getting them to pay attention to you,
and getting them to engage. V ictory!
 
 
 
Benchmarks–How well am I doing?
 

The two times I failed at cold outreach I hired people who never
tracked metrics well. The third person did. And cold reach outs
succeeded. The person who runs it (maybe you) has to know the
metrics of the sales process like the back of their hand. Every
single stat.
 
Let’ s break down the numbers with a couple platform examples. I
cannot give an example for every platform because it would take
too long. My hope is that you can generalize the concept to
whatever platform you use.
 
 
Phone Example
 
Let’ s say I make 100 cold calls per day . And, let’ s say I get a
twenty percent pick-up rate. From there, I am able to get twenty-
five percent of people to want to take my lead magnet. That means
I got four engaged leads. If it took me four hours to make those
calls, it means I got one engaged lead per hour . I can do this at
first. Once the amount of engaged leads that convert to customers
makes me more than it costs to pay a cold outreach rep–I teach
someone else to do it for me (more on this in Section IV). So you
know you do well when you make at least thr ee times  the lifetime
profit of a customer compared to what it costs you to get them.
 
Email Example
 
Let’ s say you send 100 personalized emails per day . From there,
thirty percent open our email. From there, 10% reply showing
interest. That means we’d have three engaged leads (30% x 10% =
3%). The numbers will vary but shoot for 3% of your list turning
into engaged leads . Here’ s a sample from a new campaign for a
very niche high ticket service business in our portfolio. It shows a

4% lead engagement rate. And presumably , a third of them convert
into sales. That would net us one new customer per one hundred
outreach attempts.
 
 
Direct Message Example
 
Let’ s say I make a personal video or record a personal voice memo
for one hundred people. I say their name and add one personal line
before delivering my standard message. From there, twenty percent
of people reply . W e now have twenty engaged leads. From there
we use the same A-C-A format from the warm outreach section to
qualify them for a call and so forth. So like the phone example,
you know you do well when the cost of doing cold outreach is less
than three times what you make in profit from a customer . Note:
Y ou can do W A Y better than three times, that’ s the bare minimum.
For context, the portfolio company above gets over 30:1 returns
from its outreach ef forts.
 
 
Costs
 
This method is labor intensive. Nearly all costs are in the form of
labor . In order to calculate our return on advertising, we add up all
labor and software costs associated with steps one through three in
the section before last.

 
Let’ s imagine we have a team doing cold calls:
 
W e pay them $15 per hour and $50 per shown appointment or
“shows.” 
 
W e have $3600 in profit per sale.
 
Leads cost us ten cents.  
 
They call 200 leads per day . 
 
W e would likely get about two shows per day from one rep. 
 
If they worked eight hours per day , we would pay $120 in labor
and $100 in show commissions per rep and $20 for the leads. 
 
This means we would pay $240 for two shows or $120 per
show . 
 
If we closed 33% of shows, our cost to get a client (excluding
commissions) would be $360. 
 
Since we get $3600 profit per new client, we would make a 10:1
return.
 
That’ s how cold outreach works. Then, you just add bodies. It is
boring and tedious, but brutally ef fective.
 

 
 
This Sounds Hard, Why Bother?
 
Most people dramatically underestimate the amount of volume it
takes to use cold outreach. They also underestimate how long it
takes. But there are seven enormous  benefits to using cold
outreach:
 
1)  Y ou don’ t need to create lots of content or ads . Y ou focus only on
one perfectly crafted message you convey to all your prospects.
Y our only goal is to make that one message better every day . There
is no ‘ad fatigue’ or ‘banner blindness’ since your prospects have
never seen anything from you. So, you don't need to be a marketing
genius to make this work.
 
2)  Y our competition won’ t know what you’re doing . Everything is
private. By that fact alone, you can continue to operate in secrecy .
Y ou are not educating your competitors about how you acquire
customers. They don’ t know what you're doing, or even, that you

exist.
 
3)  It’ s incredibly reliable . All you have to do to get more is do more.
A certain amount of input creates a certain number of responses. It
becomes like clockwork, bringing a reliable flow of new engaged
leads into your world. Y ou can reverse engineer the amount of sales
you want to make to the number of inputs at the top of your lead
pathway . Eventually you’ll have an equation: for every X people
contacted, you get Y customers. Then, you simply solve for X.
 
Ex: Let’ s say for every 100 emails, I get one customer . If I want
100 customers, I need to send 10,000 emails. That’ s 333 per day .
One person can send 1 1 1 emails a day . Therefore, I need three
people sending emails every day to get 100 customers per
month.
 
4)  Fewer platform changes . Private communication is rarely subject to
platform changes. Whereas public platforms change rules and
algorithms every day . Y ou gotta stay on top of rule changes to
remain ef fective. In contrast, rules for cold calling, door knocking,
and cold email have hardly changed in thirty years.
 
5)  Compliance is less painful . Many platforms have stringent rules
around claims you can make about the stuf f you sell. Some also
ban certain industries altogether (tobacco, firearms, cannabis,
weight loss, etc.). W ith cold outreach, you don't need to deal with
any of this. Y ou still need to be FTC compliant, but you don’ t also
need to worry about platform rules on top. This makes life easier . If
you have a phone, you can make money . If you have an email
account, you can get leads. This makes you very hard to stop.
 
6)  No spokesperson = Sellable business . If an investor can buy it from
you without worrying your business will stop getting customers if
you leave….your business is far  more valuable. Having an
established outreach team is how we were able to sell Gym
Launch. The business could grow without me dancing in front of

the camera or relying on me being super ridiculously good looking
(ha!). I don’ t think they would have wanted to buy us without it, or
at least, not for as much.
 
7)  Hard to copy .  Even if someone wants to copy your entire cold
outreach system, they’ll often need to learn how to do each step.
And, many steps are invisible. They don't know how you scrape
your lists. They don't know how you personalize your messages.
They don’ t know what softwares you use to distribute the messages
etc. On top of that, they’d still need to learn how to hire, train, and
operate a team of people who can do each step. Once you have a
head start, it compounds with time. It becomes very hard to catch
you.
