“Hello?”
 
I looked down to read the bullet points on my little script. “Hey
man - we’re not doing launches anymore. W e’re selling direct-to-
consumer weight loss. So we won't be coming out and–”
 
He interrupted. “But I r eally  need this right now . I just refinanced
my house and maxed out all my credit cards to keep my gym
afloat. I put my life savings into this place. Is there any way you
can help me? Y ou launched my buddy’ s gym. I know what you can
do.”
 
Given my worse than yours  situation, I didn’ t care how bad his
finances were. So I tried to sound polite. “I get that it’ s a hard time,
but we’re not flying out. I’m sorry .”
 
“Okay , okay . I get you can’ t fly out. But is there any way you can
just show me what to do? W e really need this."
 
I was beat up, exhausted, broke, and felt betrayed by the entire
industry . I should have said “no” but instead, I said… “Fine. I’ll
show you how to get leads, but I'm not flying out there to save you
if you can’ t sell.”
 
“T otally get it. It’ s on me. I can close. I just don't have anyone
walking in the door . I need LEADS. How much to show me how to
launch?”
 
I looked down at my script. This is not how it was supposed to go .
I wanted to say no and hang up. Our weight loss of fer was
working, and I didn't want distractions. He’d already told me he

was broke, so I said the biggest number I could think of to get him
of f the phone.
 
“$6000. Consider it my ‘selling my secrets’ sale.”
 
“6k?”
 
“Y es. Six thousand.” I said, articulating the whole number , hoping
to scare him of f. 
 
“6k? Okay - done.”
 
What . I stood there slack-jawed, frozen in disbelief. Six. Thousand.
Dollars . I floated out of myself and watched the conversation
happen. I still get choked up thinking about it.
 
“Oh…uhh…great…what card do you wanna use?” Now , trying not
to scare away the Six. Thousand. Dollars . Panicked, I wrote his
card information on the flap of a cardboard box.
 
“When do I start?” he asked.
 
“I’ll send you everything Monday morning.” Giving myself the
insane task of packaging my entire gym leads and sales system in
forty-eight hours. He agreed.
 
I hung up and sat in shock. Once I came to my senses, I ran the
credit card. $6000…success. Is this r eal?
 

I desperately wanted to tell Leila, but she was on a sales call.
Fifteen minutes later , she walked in.
 
“Got another one,” she said.
 
“Y ou won’ t believe this. I just sold our Gym Launch system for
$6000 to the gym in Boise.”
 
“What? I thought we were doing weight loss.”
 
"Y ea, I know . So did I, but…” She waited. “…I think we’re still in
the gym business…I think we were just doing it wrong.” She
needed more details. I didn’ t have any yet. “I’m gonna call the
gyms we planned to launch next month and see if they’ll buy it
too.”
 
“Uhhh…okay .” She said.
 
The next call went the same except when he said “How much?” I
said, “$8,000.” He agreed.
 
Next call, same thing, except I said, “$10,000.” He agreed.
 
All eight gyms we planned to launch said yes to licensing the
launch materials instead. In a single day , I collected $60,000
selling something with zer o cost to fulfill . In a single day , I was a
third of the way out of my $150,000 prison. I spent five years
developing that advertising system. It finally paid of f. Doing the
thing that scared me most - giving away my secr ets  - led to the
biggest breakthrough in my life.
 

“I can’ t believe it,” I said. “I think we can get out of this.”
 
“So… are we not doing the weight loss thing?”
 
“No. I guess not…I think we’ve had something here all along. W e
just had to put the pieces together .”
 
“Do you think anyone else will buy it?”
 
“I’m gonna call the thirty gyms we already launched. They know
our system works because we did it in front of them. W e also have
some gym owner leads from that conference. That should cover the
$150,000 and give us a clean slate.”
 
“Ok, then what? Is this what we’re gonna do?” She looked for
some well-deserved stability .
 
“I mean - I think so? It makes more money than the other thing,
and it’ s way easier to deliver .” She agreed. “So after I call those
leads, I’ll start running ads. I'll post our success stories in a few
gym groups to get leads from there. And I’ll also tell the gyms I’ll
pay $2000 cash for any gym they send that signs up. That gives us
ad leads, content leads, and  referral leads.”
 
***
 
In the next 30 days, we made $215,000 in pr ofit . W e covered the
$150,000 in refunds with cash to spare. W e did so well because the
average gym using our advertising system added an extra $30,000
in cash in their first 30 days. It made them mor e money than they
paid for it . It delivered - in spades . Plus, they got to keep all the
cash. They loved it. Referrals poured in.

 
I found the processing records from May-June 2017, the month it
all happened:
 
W e finished that first year at $6,820,000 in revenue. The next
calendar year we did $25,900,000 in revenue and $17,000,000 in
profit. Y ea, tens of millions . It was insane. Like, nuts. The
company continues to this day with 4500+ gym locations and
counting. And no one is more surprised than me. Something I
made actually worked... finally .
 
In 2018 we started Prestige Labs to sell supplements through our
gym client base. W e used Prestige Labs and the gyms as an
af filiate network to generate weight loss leads for each other . In
2019, we started ALAN. A new type of software company that
worked leads for local businesses. In 2020, we founded
Acquisition.com as a holding company for our business interests.
In 2021, we sold 75% of ALAN to a bigger company . I’m not
allowed to say for how much, but ALAN did $12,000,000 in
revenue in the prior twelve months. So you can use your
imagination. W e sold 66% of our supplement and gym licensing
business to American Pacific Group at a $46,200,000 valuation.
And that was after taking $42,000,000 in owner pay over the first 4
years.
 

I share this because I can still hardly believe it. All this was
because of a girl who believed in me, a credit card, and the ability
to get leads.
 
 
Important Disclaimer
 
Knowing how to get leads saved my business, my reputation, and
likely my life. It was the only way I stayed afloat. It was the reason
I kept getting second, third, fourth, and fifth chances.
 
 
I advertised a lot of dif ferent things, in a lot of dif ferent ways. I
advertised to get member leads for local gyms. I advertised to get
online weight loss leads for Leila. I advertised to get gym owner
leads to sell business services. I advertised to get af filiate leads for
our supplement company . I advertised to get agency leads for our
software. And so on. Getting leads has been my get out of jail fr ee
card with no expiration date. And at this point, it’ s faded and worn
with use.
 
I’d like to share this skill with you. I can show you how to get
more leads. And here is your first piece of good news: by reading
these words, you’re already in the top 10 percent. Most people buy
stuf f and never crack it open. I’ll also throw out a spoiler: the
further you read, the bigger the nuggets get. Just watch.
 

Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for allowing
me to do work I find meaningful. Thank you for lending me your
most valuable asset—your attention. I promise to do my best to
give you the highest possible return on it. This book delivers.
 
The world needs more entrepreneurs. It needs more fighters. It
needs more magic. And that’ s what I’m sharing with you ― magic.
 

T h e  P r o b l e m  T h i s  B o o k  S o l v e s
“Leads, lots of leads.”
 
Y ou have a pr oblem:
 
Y ou're not getting as many leads as you want because you're not
advertising enough. Period. As a result, your potential customers
are ignorant of your existence. How sad! This means less money
flows your way .
 
So now that you know you have a problem, unless you hate
helping people and making money , you kinda have to solve it.
 
How this book solves it:
 
T o make more money , you’ve gotta grow your business. Y ou can
only grow your business in two ways: 
 
1) Get more customers
 
2) Make them worth more
 

That’ s it. I grow our portfolio companies with this exact
framework. $100M Leads  focuses on number one - getting more
customers. Y ou get more customers by getting:
 
1) More Leads
 
2) Better Leads
 
3) Cheaper Leads
 
4) Reliably (think ‘from lots of places’).
 
 
Bottom line : All else being equal… when you double your leads,
you double your business .
 
This book shows you how to transform your business into a lead-
getting machine. Once you apply its models, you instantly  increase
lead flow . And, like cash flow , when leads flow , it’ s hard not to
make money . This book will solve your “not getting enough leads”
problem for good.
 
In a nutshell: I will show you how to get strangers to want  to buy
your stuf f.
 
What’ s In It For Me?

 
In one word: trust .
 
I give this book and the course that comes with it for free (or at
cost) in hopes of earning your trust. I want this book to provide
more value than any $1000 course, $30,000 coaching program, or
$100,000 degree. Although I could sell these materials that way , I
don’ t want to . I have a dif ferent model. I explain it below .
 
Who am I looking to help?
 
I want to provide value to two types of entrepreneurs. The first is
under  $1,000,000 per year in profit . My goal is to help you get to
$1,000,000 in profit per year (fo’ free) and, in so doing, earn your
trust . T ry a couple of tactics from this book, get some leads, then
try a few more, and get more leads. The more leads you get, the
better .
 
Do it enough, and you become the second type of entrepreneur: the
type making over $1,000,000 in EBITDA (fancy word for profit)
per year . Once you get there, or if that’ s you now , it would be my
honor to invest in your business and help you scale.
 
I don't sell coaching, masterminds, courses, or anything like that…
I invest. I buy equity in growing, profitable, bootstrapped
companies . Then, I use the systems, resources, and teams of all my
companies  to fast-track the growth of your  company .
 
But don’ t believe me yet... we just met .
 

 
 
My Business Model
 
My business model is simple:
 
1) Provide better free products than the marketplace’ s paid
products.
 
2) Earn the trust of entrepreneurs who make over $1,000,000 per
year in profit.

 
3) Invest in those entrepreneurs to fast-track their growth.
 
4) Help everyone else for free, for good.
 
Our process reverse-engineers success. The winners know my
models will work for them because they already have. And I know
the winners will use them because they already do. So, we operate
on shared trust.
 
This approach avoids failures and  increases the likelihood of
success. W in-win. Easy to say , but let me show you how much of a
dif ference our process makes…
 
W ithin the first 12 months, our average portfolio company 1.8x’ s
r evenue and 3.01x’ s pr ofits . And we partner for the long haul,
that's just the first 12 months. Our average portfolio company
who's been with us between 12 and 24 months, 2.3x’ s r evenue and
4.7x’ s pr ofits . As a fun exercise, plug your numbers in to see what
that would look like for you. This stuf f works .
 
That's how I know the models I'm about to show you work. They
alr eady have .
 
 
Acquisition.com’ s Mission
 
T o make r eal business accessible to everyone . Businesses solve
problems. Businesses make the world better . There are too many
problems for any one person to solve.
 

And I can’ t cure cancer , end hunger , or solve the world’ s ener gy
crisis (for now). But I can provide value to the entrepreneurs who
build the businesses that will. I want to help create as many
businesses as possible so we can solve as many problems as we
can. So I share these business-building frameworks rather than
hoard them. Fair enough?
 
Cool. Let’ s press on.
 
 
Basic Outline of This Book
 
I laid this book out from zero clients, zero leads, zero advertising,
zero money , zero skills (Section II) to max clients, max leads, max
advertising, max money , and max skills (Section IV). W e learn
more skills as we progress in the book. And when we have more
skills, we can get mor e leads  in the same amount of time . So, we
finish with the most complex skills that get us the most leads for
our time spent. W e save them for the end because they take lots of
skills and  money . And, getting good and having money takes time.
I want this book to help a person get their first five clients and
crack their first ten million-dollar month and beyond.
 
This order also reminds those with  skills and money , me included,
of the basics we stopped doing. Our businesses deserve better .
Respecting the tried-and-true methods that got you to your current
level will probably get you to the next one. Masters never don’ t do
the basics.
 
So, we go from getting your first lead all the way to building a
$100,000,000+ leads machine. Here’ s the breakdown:
 
Section I:  Y ou’r e about to finish r eading it right now .

 
Section II : I reveal what makes advertising r eally  work. Most
entrepreneurs think about advertising the wrong way . Since they
think about advertising the wrong way , they do the wrong stuf f to
get leads. Y ou want to do the right stuf f to get leads. This is the
way .
 
Section III : W e learn advertising’ s “core four .” There are only four
ways to get leads. So if there is a most important “how to” section,
it’ s this one.
 
Section IV : W e learn how to get other people (customers,
employees, agencies, and af filiates) to do it all for you. And this
completes the assembly of your fully functioning $100M Leads
machine.
 
Section V : W e wrap up with a one-page advertising plan you can
use to get more leads today .
