Monetize Y our Audience
 
“Give-give-give, give-give-give, until they ask”
 
 
The point of this chapter is to show you how to monetize your
warm audience. First, we talk about how we can make of fers and
not be a spam monster - mastering the give : ask ratio. Then we’ll
talk about the two of fer strategies to monetize the audience. After
that, I’ll talk about how to scale your output so you can grow a
bigger audience faster and make even more money . Then, I’ll share
a bunch of lessons I’ve learned in building my own audience that I
wish I had known sooner . Finally , I’ll wrap this up with how you
can take action on everything today .
 
 
Mastering the Give : Ask ratio
 

Gary V aynerchuk popularized “jab, jab, jab, right hook.” It
simplifies the idea of giving to your audience many times before
making an ask. Y ou deposit goodwill with rewarding content, then
withdraw from it by making of fers. When you deposit goodwill,
your audience pays more attention. When you deposit goodwill,
your audience is more likely to do what you ask. So I try to “under -
ask” my audience and build as much goodwill as possible.
 
Thankfully , the give : ask ratio has been well-studied. T elevision
averages 13 minutes of advertising per 60 minutes of air time. That
means 47 min are dedicated to ‘giving,’ and 13 min are dedicated
to ‘asking’. That’ s roughly a 3.5:1 ratio of giving to asking. On
Facebook, it’ s roughly 4 content posts for every 1 ad on the
newsfeed. This gives us an idea of the minimum give : ask ratio we
can sustain. After all, television and Facebook are mature
platforms. They care less about growing their audiences and care
more about making money from them. So they give less and ask
more. Which means “give, give, give, ask” is the ratio that gets us
closer to maximally monetizing  an audience without shrinking it.
But, most of us want to grow , so we shouldn’ t model them. W e
should model growing platforms.
 
So what do growing platforms do? They display lots of content
without many advertisements at all. In short, they give give give…
give give give…give give give…give give give…maybe ask. They
dramatically over give and under ask. Why? Because the more you
reward your audience, the bigger it gets. So if you want to grow an
audience, give far far more than you ask.
 


 
And now that I have some experience with it, I’ve got a slight
tweak on the traditional give-ask strategy that puts it on steroids:
Give until they ask.
 
 
People are always waiting for you to ask for money . And when you
don’ t, they trust you more. They share your stuf f more. Y ou grow
faster , etc. But I’m not some altruistic saint. I’m here to make
money . After all, I wouldn’ t be a good businessman if I weren’ t
making any .
 
So, it’ s simple. If you give enough, people start asking you . It
makes people uncomfortable to continue to receive without giving
back. It is core to our culture and DNA. They’ll go to your website,
DM you, email you, etc., to ask for more. Not only that, when you
use this strategy , you get the best  customers. They are the ones
who are the biggest ‘givers.’ They are the ones who, even as
paying customers, still feel they get the better end of the deal. And
best of all, if you advertise this way , your gr owth never slows .
When you use this strategy , you give in public, ask in private . Y ou
let the audience self-select when they’re ready to give you money .
That’ s why , in my opinion, give until they ask  is the best strategy .
But, if you feel like asking, I get it. So, let’ s talk about how to ask.
If you’re gonna do it, you might as well do it well.
 

Bottom Line:  The moment you start asking for money is the
moment you decide to slow down your growth. So the more patient
you are, the more you will get when you finally make your ask.
 
Action Step:  Give give give give give give until they ask
 
 
 
How T o Make Money Fr om Content: Ask
 
 
T o be clear , I think you should use the give until they ask  strategy .
But, if you need to pay rent, feed your family , etc., I get it.
Sometimes you gotta ask. So let’ s talk about how to do that
without sounding like a nincompoop.
 

Think of ‘asks’ as commercials. Y ou interrupt this pr ogram with a
very important message . Since you are the one providing the value,
you interrupt your own content with commercials about the stuf f
you sell. But, since it’ s your audience, you pay the cost of potential
loss of trust, slowing growth, and of course, the time it took you to
gather the audience in the first place. But money-wise, it’ s free.
Now , I use two strategies to weave promotions into content:
integrated of fers and intermittent of fers. Let’ s cover both.
 
 
Integrated : Y ou can advertise in every piece of content so long as
you keep your give : ask ratio high. Y ou will continue to grow your
warm audience and  get engaged leads. W in-win.
 
For example, if I make an hour -long podcast, having 3 x 30-second
ads means I’d have 58.5 min of giving to 1.5 min of asking. W ell
above the 3:1 ratio.
 
On the flip side, I had a friend who had a podcast that blew up
quickly . Eager to monetize his new audience, he started making
of fers (asking) too frequently - in-  the content. His podcast not only
stopped growing, it actually shrank! Don’ t be like that. Don’ t kill
your golden goose. It’ s a balancing act. Over -give to protect your
most valuable asset - the goodwill of your audience.
 

Action step : I most commonly integrate the ‘asks’ - aka - CT As
after a valuable moment or the end of the content piece. Consider
trying one of those places first - and make sure your audience
growth doesn’ t slow . Then add in the second and so forth.
 
 
 
Intermittent : The second way you can monetize is through
intermittent asks. Here’ s how it works. Y ou make many pieces of
content of pure ‘gives’ then occasionally make an ‘ask’ piece.
Example: Y ou make 10 ‘give’ posts, and on the 1 1th, you promote
your stuf f.
 

The dif ference between the first way and the second way depends
on the platform. On short platforms, the intermittent way will
dominate. On long-form platforms, integrations are often your best
bet.
 
When you make your ask, you either advertise  your cor e offer ,  or
you advertise your lead magnet . That’ s it. Don’ t overcomplicate
this.
 
Lead Magnet Example:  If I just talked about a way to get more
leads on a post/video/podcast/etc., I would then say , “I have 1 1
more tips that have helped me do this. Go to my site to grab a
pretty visual of them.” And as long as I have an audience that
wants to get more leads, this will get some of them to engage.
Then, the thank you page after the opt-in page for my lead magnet
would display my paid of fer with some video explaining how it
works. Bonus points if your lead magnet is relevant to your content
advertising it.
 
Of fer Example : Y ou can also ‘go for the jugular ’ with your core
of fer and go straight for the sale. The direct path to money . W e
model our of fer from the last chapter .
 
“I’m looking for 5 (specific avatar) to help achieve (dr eam
outcome) in (time delay). The best part is, you don’ t have to (effort
and sacrifice). And if you don’ t get (dr eam outcome), I will do two
things (incr ease per ceived likelihood of achievement): 1) I will
hand you your money back 2) I will work with you until you do. I
do this because I want everyone to have an amazing experience
with us and because I’m confident I can deliver on my pr omise. If
that sounds fair , DM me/book a call/comment below/r eply to this
email/ etc.”
 
After you make your ask, get back to providing value.

 
*^This box is an example of an integration.
 
Action Step One : Pick whether you integrate it or make an
intermittent ask. Then, pick whether you’ll advertise your core
of fer or lead magnet. If you’re not sure, do the lead magnet. It’ s
lower risk.
 
How to Scale It
 


 
After you start asking, you’re gonna start getting leads and making
money . But you don't want to stop there, do you? Didn’ t think so.
Cool, so let’ s talk about scale.
 
There are two opposing strategies to scale your warm audience.
They both follow progressive steps. First, you have the depth-then-
width approach. Then, you have the width-then-depth approach.
Both are right. Here’ s how they work:
 
Depth then width:  Maximize a platform, then move onto the next
platform.
 
Step #1:  Post content on a relevant platform.
 
Step #2:  Post content regularly on that platform.
 
Step #3 : Maximize quality and quantity of the content on that
platform. Short form, you may sometimes be able to get up
to ten times per day per platform. Long form, you may have
to get up to five days per week (see soap operas).
 
Step #4 : Add another platform while maintaining the quality and
quantity on the first platform.
 
Step #5:  Repeat steps 1-4 until all relevant platforms are maximized.
 
Advantages : Once you figure out one platform, you maximize
your return on that ef fort. Audiences compound faster the more
you do. Y ou take advantage of this compounding. Fewer resources
are required to make this work.

 
Disadvantages : Y ou have less low hanging fruit of new platforms
and new audiences. Y ou don’ t accomplish the feeling of
‘omnipresence.’ In the beginning, you risk your business being
reliant on a single channel. This is a risk because platforms change
all the time and sometimes ban you for no reason. If you only have
one way to get customers, it can kill your business if it gets shut
down.
 
W idth then depth :  Get on every platform early , then maximize
them together .
 
Step #1:  Post content on a relevant platform.
 
Step #2:  Post content regularly on that platform.
 
Step #3:  Her e’ s wher e this strategy differs fr om the one befor e.
Instead of maximizing your first platform. Move onto the
next relevant platform while maintaining the previous.
 
Step #4:  Continue until you are on all relevant platforms.
 
Step #5:  Now , maximize your content creation on all platforms at
once.
 
Advantages : Y ou reach a broader audience faster . And, you can
“repurpose” your content. So with a little extra work, you can
capture tons of ef ficiency . W ith minimal changes to the format,
you can make the same content fit multiple platforms. For
example, it takes little extra ef fort to format a single short video
across all platforms distributing short video content.
 

Disadvantages : It costs more labor , attention, and time, to do this
well. Oftentimes, people end up with lots of bad content
everywhere. Sucky fluf f. No bueno.
 
If you already have a sizable business, scale up faster and reap the
rewards of an asset that only gets better with time. I said it before
and I’ll say it again. The best day to start posting content was the
day you were born. The second best day is today . Don’ t wait like I
did.
 
 

Action Step : Pick an approach. Start posting. Then, go up the
scaling steps over time.
 
 
 
 
Why Y ou Should Make Content (even if it’ s not your primary
advertising strategy)
 
January 2020.
 
I called all the major departments to a meeting to answer an
important question: Why isn’ t our paid advertising working like it
used to? Opinions flooded the room. “The creative…the copy…the
of fer…our pages…our sales process…our price…” They shot back
and forth at each other , every bit as invested as I was in solving the
problem.
 
Leila and I sat quietly as the team debated. After the din died
down, Leila, in her wise fashion, asked a dif ferent question: What
did we stop  doing in the months befor e the decline ?

 
A new debate arose and a unanimous answer surfaced: Alex
stopped making gym content and started talking about general
business. Now , I didn’ t know how important that was, but I had to
find out. So, I sent a survey to our gym owners. I asked if they had
consumed any content of mine befor e  they booked a call. The
results astounded me.
 
78% of all clients had consumed at least TWO long form pieces of
content, prior to booking a call.
 
I had fallen into my old ways and given paid ads all the credit. But,
our free content was nurturing the demand. Don’ t make the same
mistake I did. Y our free content gives strangers an opportunity to
find, get value from, and share your stuf f. And, it warms people on
the fence that go to and come from the cold audience methods we
dive into next. So even if it’ s hard to measure, free content gets
you better returns on all advertising methods.
 
Bottom line:  Start making content relevant to your audience. It
will make you more money .
 
7 Lessons I’ve Learned Fr om Making Content
 
1)  Switch fr om “How to” to “How I.” Fr om “This is the best way”
to “These ar e my favorite ways” etc. (especially when starting
out). T alk about what you’ve done, not what others should do.
What you like, not this is the  best. When you talk about experience,
no one can question you. This makes you bulletproof.
 
a)   I make my oatmeal this way vs. you should make your
oatmeal this way .
 

b)  How I Built My 7-Figure Agency vs. How T o Build a 7-
Figure Agency .
 
c)   My favorite way to generate leads for my business vs. This is
the best way to generate leads for your business.
 
It’ s subtle. But when you tell your experience, you are sharing
value. When you tell a stranger what to do, it's hard to avoid
coming of f preachy or arrogant. This helps avoid it.
 
2)  W e Need T o Be Reminded Mor e Than W e Need T o Be T aught:
Y ou’re a silly goose if you think 100 percent of your audience
listens 100 percent of the time.  For example, I post about my book
every single day . I surveyed my audience and asked them if they
knew I had a book. One in five that saw the post said they didn’ t
know . Keep repeating yourself. Y ou’ll get bored of your content
before your whole audience even sees it.
 
3)  Puddles, Ponds, Lakes, Oceans. Narrow the focus of your content.
If you have a small local business, you probably shouldn’ t make
general business content. Not at first, at least. Why? The audience
will listen to people with better track records than you. But you can
narrow your topics to what you do and the place you do it.
Example: plumbing in a certain town. If you do that, you can
become king of that puddle. Over time, you can expand your
plumbing puddle to the general local business pond. Then the lake
of brick & mortar chains and so forth. Then eventually , the ocean
of general business.
 
4)  Content Cr eates T ools For Salespeople . Some content will
perform well and get more people interested in buying your stuf f.
That content helps your sales team . Create a master list of your
“greatest hits.” Label each ‘hit’ with the problem it solves and the
benefit it provides. Then, your sales team can send it before or after
sales calls and help people decide to buy . They work especially
well if the content resolves specific concerns prospects commonly

face.
 
5)  Fr ee Content Retains Paying Customers . How a customer gets
value from you matters less than where they got it. Imagine a
person pays for your thing and then consumes your free content. If
your free content is valuable, they will like you more and stay loyal
to your business longer . On the flip side, if they consume your free
content, and it sucks, they will like your paid product less. Here’ s
something you may not know .  Somebody who buys your stuf f is
mor e likely  to consume your free content. This is why it’ s so
important to make your free content good - your customers will
include it in how they calculate their ROI from your paid thing.
 
6)  People don't have shorter attention spans, they have higher
standards. Repeated for emphasis: ther e’ s no such thing as too
long, only too boring.  Streaming platforms have proven that people
will spend hours binging long form content if  they like  it . Our
biology hasn't changed, our circumstances have. They have more
rewarding stuf f to choose from. So make good stuf f people like and
reap the rewards rather than whining about people’ s “short
attention spans.”
 
7)  A void Pr e-Scheduling Posts . The posts I manually post perform
better than ones I pre-schedule. Here’ s my theory . When you
manually post, you know that within seconds you will be rewarded
or punished for the quality of the content. Because of that close
feedback loop, you try *that much harder* to make it better . When
I schedule stuf f out, I don’ t feel that same pressure. So whenever I
post, or my team does, we strongly believe in someone pressing the
‘submit’ button because it gives that last bit of pressure to get it
right. T ry it.
 
 
Benchmarks - How W ell Am I Doing?
 

If our audience grows, we did good. But if our audience grows
fast, we did gooder . So I like to measure my audience size and
speed of growth monthly .
 
Here’ s what I measure:
 
1)  T otal followers and reach - How big
 
a)   Follower Example: If I go from 1000 followers across
all platforms to 1500, I grew my audience by 500. 
 
b)  Reach Example: If I go from 10,000 people seeing my
stuf f to 15,000 people seeing my stuf f, I grew my r each
by 5,000 people.
 
2)  Rate of getting followers and reach - How fast
 
Y ou compare the growth between months:
 
a)   Example: If I gained those 500 followers in a month,
that would make it a 50% growth month. (500 New /
1000 Started = 50% growth rate).
 
b)  Example: If I reached those 5000 extra people in a
month, that would make it a 50% growth month. (5000
New / 10,000 Started = 50% growth rate)
 
Remember , we can only control inputs. Measuring outputs is only
useful if we are consistent with inputs. So, pick the posting
cadence you want to stick with on a particular platform. Then pick
your ‘ask’ cadence on that platform (how you will direct people to
become engaged leads). Then, start, and…Do. Not. Stop.
 

 
For reference, I posted a new podcast twice a week for four years
before even getting picked up on the T op 100 list. Because I did
the same thing every week for years, I knew I could trust the
feedback. In the beginning, it didn't grow much. It took time for
me to get better . And I knew I had to make more, over a long time,
for that to happen.
 
So if your listeners go from ten to fifteen in a month, that’ s
progress baby! Even with small absolute numbers, that’ s fifty
percent monthly growth! It’ s why I like to measure both the
absolute and relative growth and pick the one that makes me feel
better (ha!). As my friend Dr . Kashey says, “The more ways you
measure, the more ways you can win.” Be consistent. Measure a
lot. Adapt to feedback. Be a winner .
 
T o close the loop, in its fifth year , my podcast- The Game ,  became
a T op 10 podcast in the US for business and top 500 in the world.
This was only possible after 5 years of multiple podcasts per week
every week . Remember , everyone starts at zero. Y ou just gotta give
time, time .
 
 
Y our First Post
 

Y ou’ve probably been providing value to other humans knowingly
or unknowingly for a while. So the first post you make, you can
make an ask.  My hope is that it gets you your first engaged lead. If
it doesn’ t, you need to give for a while, then make an ask once
you’ve earned the right to. T o show you that I’m not making this
up, below you can find my first business post ever . Is it ideal? No.
I had no idea what I was doing. Should you copy it, probably not.
Main point: don’ t be afraid of what other people think. If someone
won’ t speak at your funeral, you shouldn’ t care about their opinion
while you’re alive. Honor the few who believe in you by having
courage.
 
 
Whenever I read this, I just think “you goon.” But hey , I was
trying. And for that, I’m proud.

Now , you know . Nothing’ s stopping you.
 
 
So What Do I Do Right Now?
 
Posting free content is less predictable than, but complementary to,
warm reach outs. So keep doing warm r each outs. Also, posting
free content grows your warm audience. And a bigger warm
audience means more people for warm reach outs. So free content
gets engaged leads on its own and keeps getting  engaged leads
through warm reach outs. Instead of ditching one for the other , I
recommend you post free content in addition to  warm reach outs.
 
Let’ s fill out our daily action commitment for our first platform.
 

 
 
Next Up
 
First, we start with warm outreach. W e reach out to every person
we have permission to contact. Second, we post publicly about the
successes and lessons we have from our first clients. W e post
testimonials. W e provide value. Then occasionally ask. W e commit
to doing both of these activities every day .
 
W ith these two methods alone can eventually build a six- or seven-
figure business. But you may want to go faster . So we venture from
warm audiences who know us, to cold audiences who don’ t. W e
begin r eaching out to strangers . This begins the third step in our
advertising journey: cold outreach.
