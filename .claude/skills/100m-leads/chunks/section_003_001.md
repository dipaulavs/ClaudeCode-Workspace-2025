# Leads Alone Aren't Enough

**Path:** Section II: Get Understanding/Leads Alone Aren't Enough
**Type:** chapter

Advertising. Simplified.
 
 
In this section, we cover three things to make sure advertising does
exactly what we want it to do.
 
First, we talk about what a lead actually is. If we want more of
them, then we better be darn well sure we’re talking about the
same thing. Second, we learn how to separate leads that make you
money from leads that waste your time. Third, I show you the best
ways I know to get the leads that  make you money to show inter est
in the stuff you sell.
 
Let’ s dive in.

L e a d s  A l o n e  A r e n ’ t  E n o u g h
“If you cannot explain something in simple terms, then you don’ t
understand it.”
- Dr . Richar d Feynman, Nobel Prize W inner in Physics
 
 
I’ll let you in on a little secret. This book started because
somebody asked me what a lead was. Y ou’d think it would be
simple, but I couldn’ t give a straight answer . And after six months
of trying to figure it out,  I was more confused than before. It
became clear I didn't know as much about leads as I thought . My
search for a clear  definition of “a lead” snowballed into the
massive project that became $100M Leads. All this to say , we’ve
got to agree on what the heck a lead is before we dive head first
into getting them...
 
So what’ s a lead anyways?
 
Someone who clicks an ad?
 
A phone number?
 

A person that schedules a call?
 
A list of names?
 
A door you knock on?
 
A walk-in?
 
An email address?
 
A subscriber?
 
A person that sees your content?
 
Etc…
 
Y ou see, words matter because they af fect how we think. How we
think af fects what we do. And if words have us thinking the wrong
way , then we will probably do the wrong stuf f. I hate doing the
wrong stuf f. So to do the right stuf f more and the wrong stuf f less,
it’ s best we know what words mean and use them.
 
T o cut the suspense, a lead  is a person you can contact . That’ s all.
If you bought a list of emails, those are leads. If you get contact
information from a website or database, those are leads. The
numbers in your phone are leads. People on the street are leads. If
you can contact them, they ar e leads.
 
But what I came to realize was - leads alone ar en’ t enough . W e
want  engaged  leads:  people who *show* inter est in the stuff you

sell . If someone gives  their contact information on a website, that
is an engaged lead. If someone follows  you on social media and
you can contact them, that is an engaged lead. If people r eply  to
your email campaign, they are engaged leads. The leads showing
inter est  are the leads that matter .
 
Engaged leads are the true output of advertising.
 
Getting more engaged  leads is the point of this book. But I
couldn’ t call the book “engaged leads” because no one would get
it. But now you do. So the next question is: How do we get leads to
engage?

“I don’ t do drugs. I am drugs” - Salvador Dali
 
 
April 2016.
 
I paid $25,000 to be in this group, and everyone  told me to do a
webinar . In fact, my mentor at the time told me, “Do a webinar
every week until you make a million dollars. Until then, don’ t ask
me about anything else.” This is my only path to success.  I’ve got
to figur e this out.
 
A webinar , as I understood it, was a magical presentation with a
zillion slides. If somebody watched, it would hypnotize them into
buying my thing.
 
There was so much I didn't know . Landing pages. Registration
pages. Follow-up emails. Replay emails. Cart close emails.
Presentation software. W ebsite integration. W riting ads. Making ad
creative. Figuring out where to put the ads. Who to show the ads
to. Building a payment page. Processing payments. Never mind
making the actual webinar . The list overwhelmed me.
 

So, I started with what I understood most, the landing page. I built
a few of those for my gyms. My mentor made millions with
webinars, so I modeled his landing page. But I didn’ t need it to
make millions. I just needed it to make something .
 
Okay ...now the “thank you” page.
 
An entire Sunday later , the “thank you” page went live. Now for
the big test.  I put my email into the landing page, clicked “sign me
up,” and waited. My brand new thank you page loaded. Success. I
still wasn’ t a millionaire, sad face. But it was something.
 
The following Sunday , I sat down for my regular ‘work on  the
business, not in  the business’ ritual. I had ten hours to figure out
the next piece of this webinar puzzle. After my first cup of cof fee, I
decided I didn’ t really want to work, but I still wanted to feel
productive. So I went to my advertising group’ s forum to get some
tips.
 
“Just got off my webinar . $32k in an hour! I ROI’d the entir e
tuition in my first week! W ebinars r ock!”
 
I’m never gonna make this work . He joined the same month as me.
He was in the same industry as me. He figured out how to make
money with his webinar before me. He was stealing all the clients
before I even got a chance. Everyone is making money except me.
 
Desperate, I called other people in the group. “I will do anything
for your business: build a sales team… write your sales scripts…
fix your sales process… anything… just help me finish this
webinar …please?” One person agreed to help me. Thank God.
 

Eight Sundays later , and the little circle next to my ad campaign
turned green. It’ s alive! I was of ficially spending $150 per day on
ads. All I had to do now was watch the money pour in. I was gonna
be rich!
 
Thr ee days, $450, 80 leads, and 0 sales later…
 
I shut it all down. I suck.
 
No one even watched my webinar . Meanwhile, that guy posted
again  about how much money he was making of f this webinar
stuf f. Why do I suck so much?
 
I spent most of my money to join this group, and I just set another
$450 on fire. I didn’ t have the money to fail again. I needed  the
next thing to work. And if I couldn’ t even get anyone to watch,
what was the point?
 
 
The case study:
 
I scrolled my newsfeed to see what other people were doing. An ad
caught my eye. “Free Case Study on How I Spent $1 and Made
$123,000 in a W eekend” or something like that. I punched in my
email, and the page sent me to a video of walking through a
successful advertising campaign. Nothing fancy . No slides. No
“presenting.” Just a dude explaining how his stuf f worked.
 
This, I can do.
 
I fired up my screen recorder:

 
Okay everyone. So her e’ s the ad account of a gym we just
launched. Her e ar e the ads we ran. This is how much we spent. W e
sent them to this page with this offer . Y ou can see how many leads
we got her e. They got this many people scheduled. This many
showed. This is how many they sold. This is how much the gym
owner made. This is everything we did. If you want help setting
something like this up, we’ll do the whole thing for fr ee. And we
only get paid off the sales you make. If that sounds fair , book a
call.
 
It took maybe 13 minutes. Simple. I swapped the webinar out for
this video and changed the headline:
 
“FREE Case Study: How we added 213 members and $1 12,000 in
revenue to a small gym in San Diego.”
 
They would book a call on the next page.
 
I set up a fresh ad campaign and went to bed.
 
 
The next morning…
 
“Alex…what did you do?” Leila asked.
 
“What do you mean?”
 
“Strangers have booked my calendar solid for like the next week.”
 

“Really?”
 
“Y ea. Did you start a new campaign or something?”
 
“Y ea… but I didn’ t think it would go live so fast. W ait. People
booked calls!?”
 
“Y ea. T ons.”
 
Seeing Leila’ s calendar stacked with appointments filled me with
joy . It’ s working!
 
I learned an important lesson. They didn't want my webinar . But
they did want my case study . This accidental discovery showed me
how getting leads actually works…you have to give people
something they want. The best part is - it’ s easier than you think.
 
 
Lead Magnets Get Leads to Engage

 
Offers  are what you promise to give in exchange for something of
value. Often, a business promises to give its product or service in
exchange for money . This is a cor e offer . If you advertise your core
of fer , then you go straight for the sale–the direct path to money .
Advertising your core of fer might be all you need to get leads to
engage. T ry this way first.
 
 
Sometimes, though, people want to know more about your of fer
before they buy . This is common for businesses that sell more
expensive stuf f. If that’ s you, then you’ll often get more leads to
engage by advertising with a lead magnet first. A lead magnet  is a
complete solution to a narrow problem . It’ s typically  a lower -cost
or free of fer to see who is interested in your stuf f. And, once
solved, it reveals another problem solved by your cor e offer . This is
important because leads interested in lower -cost or free of fers now
are more likely to buy a related higher -cost of fer later .

 
Think of it like salty pretzels at a bar . If somebody eats the
pretzels, they’ll get thirsty and order a drink. The salty pretzels
solve the narrow problem of hunger . They also reveal a thirst
problem solved by a drink, which they can get, in exchange for
money . The pretzels have a cost, but when done right, the drink
revenue covers the cost of the pretzels and  nets a profit.
 
So your lead magnet should be valuable enough on its own that
you could  char ge for it. And, after they get it, they should want
mor e  of what you of fer . This gets them one step closer to buying
your stuf f. A person who pays with their time now is mor e likely to
pay with their money later .
 
Good lead magnets get more engaged leads and customers than a
core of fer alone, and do it for less money . So let’ s make a lead
magnet, shall we?
 
 
 
Seven Steps T o Cr eating an Effective Lead Magnet
 

Step 1: Figure out the problem you want to solve and who to solve it
for
 
Step 2: Figure out how to solve it
 
Step 3: Figure out how to deliver it
 
Step 4: T est what to name it
 
Step 5: Make it easy to consume
 
Step 6: Make it darn good
 
Step 7: Make it easy for them to tell you they want more
 
 
Something to keep in mind befor e we start - Grand Slam Of fers
work for free stuf f as much or better than they do for paid stuf f. So
make your lead magnet so insanely good people will feel stupid
saying no. And yes, this means you may have a few insanely
valuable of fers (even if some are free). But that’ s a good  thing. The
business that provides the most value wins. Period. So let’ s get
started.
 
 
Step 1: Figur e out the pr oblem you want to solve and who to
solve it for
 
Here’ s a simple example we can walk through together…this book
is a lead magnet. Y ou are a lead. I want to solve an engaged lead

problem. And I want to solve it for businesses making less than
$1,000,000 in annual profit. W ith enough engaged leads, they can
make mor e than  $1,000,000+ in annual profit. Then, they qualify
for my core of fer: me investing in their company to help them
scale.
 
The first step is picking the problem to solve. I use a simple model
to figure this out. I call it the Problem-Solution cycle. Y ou can see
it below .
 
 
Every problem has a solution. Every solution reveals more
problems. This is the never -ending cycle of business (and life).
And, smaller problem-solution cycles sit inside lar ger problem-
solution cycles. So how do we pick the right problem to solve?
 
W e start by picking a problem that’ s narrow and  meaningful. Then,
solve it. And, like we just learned, when we solve one problem, a

new problem reveals itself. Here comes the important part- if we
can solve that new pr oblem with our cor e offer , we’ve got a winner .
This is because we solve this new problem in exchange for money .
That’ s it. Don’ t overthink it.
 
Example : Imagine we help homeowners sell their homes. That is a
br oad  solution. But what about the steps befor e  selling a home?
Owners want to know what their house is worth. They want to
know how to increase its value. They need pictures. They need it
cleaned. They need landscaping. They need minor things fixed.
They need moving services. They may need staging. Etc. These are
all narr ow  problems–great for lead magnets. W e pick one of the
narrow problems and solve it for free. And although it helps, it
makes their other problem more obvious– they still have to sell
their home.  But now we’ve earned their trust. So we can char ge to
solve the remaining problems with our core of fer and help them
achieve their broader goal.
 
Action Step : Pick the narrowly defined problem you want to solve.
Then, make sure your core of fer can solve the next problem that
comes up.
 
 
Step 2: Figur e out how to solve it
 
There are three types of lead magnets and each of fers a dif ferent
type of solution.
 
First, if your audience has a problem they don’ t know about, your
lead magnet would make them aware of it. Second, you could
solve a recurring problem for a short amount of time with a sample
or trial of your core of fer . Third, you can give them one step in a
multi-step process that solves a bigger problem. All three solve one

problem and reveal others. So your three types are: 1) Reveal
Problems, 2) Samples and T rials, and 3) One Step Of A Multi-Step
Process.
 
 
1)  Reveal Their Pr oblem . Think “diagnosis.” These lead magnets
work great when they reveal problems that get worse the longer
you wait .
 
○    Example: Y ou run a speed test that shows their website loads
at 30% below the speed it should. Y ou draw a clear line
between where they should be and how much money they
lose by being below standards. 
 
○    Example: Y ou do a posture analysis and show them what their
posture should look like. Y ou draw a clear line to what their
pain-free life would look like if their posture were fixed and
how you can help.
 
○    Example: Y ou do a termite inspection that reveals what
happens when the bugs eat their home. If they do have
termites, you can get rid of them for cheaper than the cost
of… another home. If they don’ t, they can pay you to prevent
the termites from coming to begin with! Y ou can sell ‘em
either way . W in-win!
 

2)  Samples And T rials . Y ou give full but brief access to your core
of fer . Y ou can limit the number of uses, time they have access, or
both. This works great when your core of fer is a recurring solution
to a recurring problem. 
 
○    Example: Y ou hook them up to your faster server and show
their website loading at lightning speed. They get more
customers from your faster load times. If they want to keep it,
they need to keep paying you. 
 
○    Example: Y ou give a free adjustment for their bad posture and
they experience relief. T o get permanent benefits, they must
buy more. 
 
○    Example: Food, cosmetics, medicine, or any other
consumable s. Consumables, by nature, have limited uses and
solve recurring problems... with recurring use. So single
serving, “fun sized,” etc. samples are great lead magnets. It’ s
how Costco sells more food than other stores–they give out
samples!
 

 
3)  One Step Of A Multi-Step Pr ocess . When your core of fer has
steps, you can give one valuable step for free and the rest when
they buy . This works great when your core of fer solves a more
complex problem.
 
○    Example: This book. I help you get to $1,000,000+ per year
in profit. Then you’ll have new problems we can help you
solve, and scale from there. 
 
○    Example: Y ou give away a free wood sealant for a garage
door . But the sealing process requires three dif ferent coats to
protect from all weather conditions. I do the first one free,
explain how it only gives partial coverage, and of fer the other
two in a bundle. 
 
○    Example: Y ou give away free finance courses, guides,
calculators, templates, etc. They are so valuable people really
can do it all themselves. But, they also reveal the time, ef fort,

and sacrifice of doing it all. So you of fer financial services to
solve all that.
 
Action Step : Pick how you want to solve your narrowly defined
problem.
 
 
 
Step 3: Figur e out how to deliver it
 

 
There are unlimited ways to solve problems. But my favorite lead
magnets solve them with: software, information, services, and
physical products. And each of those works great with the three
types of lead magnets from step two. I’ll show you what I’ve done
to attract gym owners using each lead magnet type.
