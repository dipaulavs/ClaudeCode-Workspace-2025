# Engage Your Leads: Offers and Lead Magnets

**Path:** Section II: Get Understanding/Engage Your Leads: Offers and Lead Magnets
**Type:** chapter

---

1)  Software : Y ou give them a tool . If you have a spreadsheet,
calculator , or small software, your technology does a job for them. 
 
Ex: I give away a spreadsheet or dashboard that gives a gym owner
all their relevant business stats, compares them to industry
averages, then gives them a rank. 
 
2)  Information : Y ou teach them something . Courses, lessons,
interviews with experts, keynote presentations, live events,
mistakes and pitfalls, hacks/tips, etc. Anything they can learn  from.
 
Ex: I give away a mini course for gyms on how to write an ad. 
 
3)  Services : Y ou do work for fr ee . Adjust their back. Perform a website
audit. Apply the first layer of garage sealant. T ransform their video
into an ebook. Etc. 
 
Ex: I run gym owner ’ s ads for free for thirty days. 
 

4)  Physical Products : Y ou give them something they can hold in their
hands . A posture assessment chart, a supplement, a small bottle of
garage door sealant, boxing gloves to get boxing gym leads, etc.
 
Ex: I sell a book for gym owners called Gym Launch Secr ets .
 
W ith three dif ferent types of lead magnets and four ways to deliver
them, that's up to twelve lead magnets that solve a single narrow
problem. So many magnets, so little time!
 
I make as many versions of a lead magnet as I can and rotate them.
This keeps the advertising fresh and  low ef fort. Plus, you see
which ones work best. Like my case study story at the beginning of
the chapter , the results are often surprising. And you won’ t know
until you try .
 
Action Step : As a thought exercise, think of a lead magnet and
then a version of it for each delivery method. Y ou always can, I
promise. Then, pick how to deliver your  lead magnet.
 
 
Step 4: T est What T o Name It
 
 
David Ogilvy said, “When you have written your headline, you
have spent 80 cents of your (advertising) dollar .” What that means
is, five times more people read your headline than any other part of

your promotion. They read it and make a snap decision to read
further… or not. Like Ogilvy hints, leads have to notice your lead
magnet befor e  they can consume it. Like it or not, this means how
we present it matters more than anything. For example, improving
the headline, name, and display of your lead magnet can 2x, 3x, or
10x your engagement. It’ s that  important. Besides, if no one shows
interest in your lead magnet, no one will ever know how good it is.
Y ou can’ t leave it to chance. So listen up. Here’ s what you do next
- you test .
 
The three things you’ll want to test are the headline, the image(s),
and the subheadline, in that order . The headline is the most
important. So if you only test one thing, test that. For example, I
had no idea what to title this book. So here’ s what I did to figure
out which name would do the best -  I tested . The results may
surprise you as much as they surprised me.
 
Headline T ests
 
Round I:  Advertising  ✔  vs. Promotion
 
Round II:  Advertising vs. Leads  ✔

 
Round III:  Marketing vs. Leads  ✔
 
Image T est
 
✔  Real vs. Cartoon
 
 
Subheadlines
 
Round I:

“How to get more people to want to buy your stuf f”
“How to get strangers to want to buy your stuf f”  ✔
 
Round II:
How to get more strangers to want to buy your stuf f”
“How to get strangers to want to buy your stuf f”  ✔
 
Round III:

“How to get as many leads as you darn well please”
“How to get strangers to want to buy your stuf f ” ✔
 
Round IV :
“Get strangers to want to buy your stuf f”
“How to get strangers to want to buy your stuf f ” ✔
 
Note two things with the subheadline tests:
 

1) “How to get strangers to want to buy your stuf f” overwhelmingly
beat “Get strangers to want to buy your stuf f.” The only dif ference is
two little words: “how to.” And it also beat “how to get mor e
strangers to want to buy your stuf f” with a single word removed
‘ mor e. ’ Small changes can make big dif ferences. 
 
2) Since so many people asked, I figured I’d answer it here. I didn’ t
subtitle the book “How to get strangers to buy your stuf f” because
that’ s sales, not getting leads. The point of this book is to get
strangers to show interest, not to buy (yet). A raised hand is where
this book ends. ‘$100M Sales’ or  'Persuasion' (I haven't decided yet)
will be a future book. One problem at a time.
 
Action Step : T est. If people engage in droves, you’ve got a winner .
 
And if you have any following at all, you can run polls like these.
Y ou don't need a lot of votes to get a directional idea. If you can’ t
do that, make a post on every platform and ask people to respond
with a ‘1’ or a ‘2’, then count ‘em up. If you still can’ t even do
that, then just message people and ask. There’ s always a way , and
this is one of the highest leverage things you can do with your time
- make sure how you package it gets engagement and you give
yourself a big head start.
 
Bonus Points: If people respond to the poll and  ask when they can
get their hands on it, you have a mega winner .
 
 
Step 5: Make it easy for them to consume
 

 
People prefer to do things that take less ef fort. So if we want more
people to take us up on our lead magnet, and consume it, we gotta
make it easy . Y ou can see 2x, 3x, and even 4x+ increases in take
rates and  consumption simply by making it easier to consume.
 
1)  Software : Y ou want to make it accessible on their phones, on a
computer and in multiple dif ferent formats. This way , they’ll pick
the one easiest for them. 
 
2)  Information : People like to consume things in dif ferent ways. Some
people like watching, other people like reading, others like
listening, etc. Make your solution in as many dif ferent formats as
you can: images, video, text, audio, etc. Of fer them all. That’ s why
this book comes in every format people consume. 
 
3)  Services : Be available at more times in more ways. More times of
day . More days of the week. V ia video call, phone call, in person,
etc. The easier you are to get a hold of, the more likely people will
become engaged leads to claim the free value. 
 

4)  Physical products : Make it super simple to order and fast to get to
them. Make the product itself fast and easy to open. Give simple
directions on how to use the product. Example : Apple made its
products so well they didn’ t even need directions. And the
packaging is so good, most people keep the boxes.
 
Action Step : Package your lead magnet in every way you can. It
dramatically increases how many engaged leads come your way .
And more leads engaging with your lead magnet means more leads
getting value from it. This is huge.
 
Fun fact: My book $100M Offers has a near perfect ¼, ¼, ¼, ¼
split between ebooks, physical books, audiobooks, and videos (free
on Acquisition.com). Making the book available in multiple
formats is the easiest way I know to get 2-3-4x the amount of leads
for the same work. If I only made it available in one format, I’d
miss out on the 3-4x the people who wouldn’ t have read the book
otherwise. What a shame that would’ve been and what a waste.
 
 
Step 6: Make it darn good:
 
Give A way The Secr ets, Sell The Implementation
 
The marketplace judges everything you have to of fer - fr ee or not .
And you can never provide too much value. But, you can provide
too little. So you want your lead magnet to provide so much value
people feel obligated to pay you. The goal is to provide more value
than the cost of your core of fer  befor e they’ve bought it.
 
Think about it this way . If you’re scared of giving away your
secrets, imagine the alternative: Y ou give away sucky fluf f. Then,
people who might've become customers think this person sucks!

They only have sucky fluff! Then, they buy from someone else. So
sad. Not only that, they tell other folks who might’ve bought from
you, not to. It’ s a vicious cycle you don’ t want to ride.
 
But remember , people buy stuf f based on how much value they
think they’ll get  after  they buy it. And the easiest way to get them
to think they’ll get tons of value after they buy is… drum roll
please… to provide them with value befor e  they buy .
 
Imagine a company scaled from $1M to $10M just by consuming
my free content. The chance they’ll partner with Acquisition.com
is huge because I paid for my shar e befor e we even started .
 
Action Step : 99% of people aren’ t gonna buy , but they will create
(or destroy) your reputation based on the value of your free stuf f. 
So, make your lead magnets as good as your paid stuf f. Y our
reputation depends on it. Provide value. Stack the deck. Reap the
rewards.
 
 
Step 7: Make it easy for them to tell you they want mor e
 
Once the leads consume the lead magnet, some of them will be
ready to buy or learn more about your of fer . This is the time to give
a Call T o Action. A  Call T o Action (CT A)  tells the audience what
to do next. But, there’ s a little more to it than that. At least, if you
want your advertising to work. Good CT As have two things: 1)
what to do and 2) reasons to do it right now .
 
What to do : CT As tell the audience to call the number , click the
button, give information, book the call, etc. There are way too
many to list. Just know CT As tell the audience how to become
engaged leads. Good CT As have clear , simple, and direct  language.

Not “ don’ t delay ” but instead “ call now .” Read the next paragraph
to learn more (see what I did there?).
 
Reasons to do it right now  - If you give people a reason to take
action, more people will do it. But a couple things to keep in mind:
first, good reasons work better than bad reasons. And second, any
reason (even bad ones) tends to work better than no reason at all.
So to get more people to take action, I include as many ef fective
reasons as I can. Here are my favorite reasons to act now:  
 
a) Scar city -  Scarcity  is when ther e is a limited amount of something.
Especially when there is a small supply  compared to demand .  When
something is scarce, like your lead magnet or of fer , people also tend
to want it more. And this is why they’re more likely to act right now .
The fewer you have, the more valuable people think it is. But there’ s a
catch- the fewer you have, the fewer engaged leads you can get before
running out. So the best strategy I know for scarcity is - r eality .  Let
me explain. If you sold 1000x the customers tomorrow , could you
handle it? If not, you have some  limit to how much you can sell.
Maybe you’re limited by customer service, onboarding, inventory ,
time slots per week, etc. Don’ t keep it a secret - advertise it. This
gives you ethical  scarcity . If you can’ t handle more than five new
customers per week, say so . Draw attention to the natural scarcity in
your business. If you have limitations you may as well use them to
make money .
 
Ex:  “The most convenient class times fill up fast. Call now to get the
one you want.”
 
“I can only handle five people per week, so if you want it solved
soon, do xyz…”
 
“W e only printed one batch of shirts and will never r eprint this
design, get one so you don’ t r egr et missing out for ever…”

 
b) Urgency . Y ou can have unlimited units to sell, but let’ s say you stop
selling them in an hour… on purpose . I bet more people than normal
will buy your thing in that hour . This is ur gency in action. Urgency is
when people act faster because they have a short amount of time. 
And the less time people have, the faster (more ur gent) they tend to
act. So if you make the time they can act on your CT A shorter , you
can get mor e  of them to act on it faster .  Y ou can also use the same
ur gency with discounts or bonuses that go away after X minutes or
hours. After which, this of fer will never be available again. 
 
Ex:  “Our July 4th pr omotion ends Monday at midnight, so if you want
it, take action now .”
 
“Our Black Friday pr omotion ends at midnight. Ther e ar e only
four hours left. Get it while the gettin’ s good.”
 
“Thr ough Friday , I’ll also thr ow in a fr ee hat to anyone who buys
mor e than thr ee books. So if you wanna look slick in an
Acquisition.com hat, buy now .”
 
 

 
c) Fraternity Party Planner (my favorite) - Make Up A Reason .
Fraternities don’ t need a reason to party - but they sure make up some
doozies. “John got his wisdom teeth removed…kegger!” “Mar gherita
Monday!” “T oga T uesdays” “Thirsty Thursday!” etc. Y our reason
doesn’ t even have to make sense, and it will still  get more people to
act.  In fact, Harvard ran an experiment showing that people were
more likely to let someone cut in line if they only gave a r eason . The
number of people that let others cut incr eased  if the reason made
sense (like scarcity and ur gency). But any r eason  still works better
than no r eason . So I always try to include one. Think ‘the stuf f you
say’ after the word because . Examples:
 
●    Because… moms know best.
 
●    Because… your country needs you.
 
●    Because… it’ s my birthday , and I want you to celebrate with me.
 
Action Step:  Give a clear , simple, action-oriented CT A. Then, give
them a ‘reason why’ using scarcity , ur gency , and any other reasons
you can think of. And, do it often. Don't be clever , be clear .
 
Even if your lead magnet costs money to deliver , it should still
lower  your cost to get a new customer . This is because more
engaged leads means more chances to get customers. And the extra
customers mor e than  cover your costs. That’ s the point.
 
Let’ s say you make $10,000 of profit on your core of fer . And it
costs you $1000 in advertising to get someone on a call for it. If
you close one out of three people, it costs you $3000 in advertising
to get a customer . Since we have $10,000 in profit to work with,
that’ s fine. But we’re savvy , we can do better . So, let’ s do better .
 

Imagine you advertise a free lead magnet instead of your core
of fer . Y our lead magnet costs you $25 to deliver , and because it’ s
free to them, more will engage. The extra engagement means it
only costs $75 in advertising to get someone on a call. All in, it’ s
$100 per call. By delivering value before they buy , you get ten
times mor e engaged leads for the same cost. Note : this happens all
the time when you nail the lead magnet.
 
Now , let’ s say one out of ten folks who get the lead magnet buys
your core of fer . This means your new cost to acquire a customer is
$1000 ($100 x 10 people). W e just cut our cost to get a customer
by 3x. So instead of spending $3000 to get a new customer , by
using a lead magnet, we spend only $1000. Given we make
$10,000, that’ s a 10:1 return. So if we keep our advertising budget
the same, and use a lead magnet, we triple our business .
Remember: the goal is to print money , not just make our “fair
share.”
 
This is where experienced business owners beat newbies. W ith a
$25 budget to deliver your lead magnet, you can provide F AR
more value than a $0 budget. Crazy , I know . Y ou attract more
customers because your lead magnet is more valuable than other
people’ s. Oftentimes, by a lot. This translates into more strangers
becoming engaged leads. It also translates into more sales because
you provided value in advance. W in. W in. W in.
 
Action Steps:
 
Step 0: If you’re struggling to get leads, make an amazing  lead
magnet.
 
Step 1: Figure out the problem you want to solve for the right
customer

 
Step 2: Figure out how you want to solve it
 
Step 3: Figure out how to deliver it
 
Step 4: Make the name interesting and clear
 
Step 5: Make it easy to consume
 
Step 6: Make sure it’ s darn good
 
Step 7: T ell them what to do next, why it's a good idea, do it
clearly , and do it often
 
 
Section II Conclusion
 
My goal with this book is to demystify the lead-getting process. In
the first chapter , we covered why leads alone aren’ t enough–you
need engaged leads . In the second chapter , we covered how to get
leads to engage - a valuable lead magnet or offer . And a good lead
magnet does four things:
 
1)  Engages ideal customers when they see it. 
 
2)  Gets more people to engage than your core of fer alone
 
3)  Is valuable enough that they consume it. 
 
4)  Makes the right people more likely to buy 
 

So, more people show interest in our stuf f. W e make more money
from them. And we deliver more value than we ever have–all at
the same time.
 
 
Next Up:
 
W e’ve armed ourselves with a powerful lead magnet. Now , I’ll
show you the four ways we can advertise it. In other words, now
that we have “the stuf f,”–we gotta tell people about it. Let’ s get
some leads.
