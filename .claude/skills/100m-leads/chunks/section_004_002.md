How T o Reach Out T o People Y ou Know
“The world belongs to those who can keep doing without seeing
the r esult of their doing.”
 
 
May 2013. Starting out.
 
For the third time that day , I pulled out my phone and checked my
bank account. $51,128.13 . I let out a small sigh of relief. It’ s
amazing how years of work and saving can fit into such a tiny
screen. Feeling good for the moment, I switched over to social
media to get more dopamine. Friends from college were applying
to business school. Acceptance letters filled my newsfeed. I, too,
started the business school application process.
 
I had a choice: I could either quit my job and go to business
school, or I could quit my job and start a business.
 

The application stared at me - How will a Harvar d MBA help your
short and long-term goals?
 
That question changed my life. I spent three days trying to answer
it. At the end of the third day , I saw the truth - it wouldn’ t .
$150,000 in loans and two years without income wouldn’ t help me
start a business. At least not as much as starting a business and
taking two years to figure it out. I could make the same amount by
the time I graduate and skip the debt . Or at least, that’ s what I told
myself.
 
So I quit my job and took the steps to start my business. I set up
Impetus Group LLC. Check. I set up a business banking account.
Check. I set up a merchant account to process payments. Check.
There still wasn’ t any money coming in, but at least I felt ‘legit.’
 
Impetus Gr oup LLC. (say it out loud...)
 
The first person I told about my new business said, “Impotence?”
God, I suck. No wonder the name was available . I immediately
changed it to ‘The Free T raining Project.’ Name that doesn’ t suck?
Check. I was in business.
 
But I had a problem - I didn’ t know anything about advertising or
sales. But I did know I needed clients. So, I just asked around
where I could. I called, texted, and sent Facebook messages to a
bunch of people I knew .
 
“Hey , do you know anyone who’ s trying to get into shape? I'm
training people for fr ee for twelve weeks. On top of that, I'll make
them a custom nutrition plan and gr ocery list. All they have to do
is donate to a charity of their choice and let me use their
testimonial.”

 
Only six people said yes. Six. T wo high school friends. One
college friend. And three people they referred.
 
I emailed everyone fitness plans and we got to work. W e texted
during the week to keep tabs on progress. Thankfully , they were all
friends of mine, so they gave it their all. They encouraged me more
than anyone in the beginning. A decade later , I still have their
before and after pictures.
 
 

And this is where the decision to skip business school started
coming back to haunt me. A few months into this, I was less sure
of myself. My ‘pile’ of money didn’ t look as big without new
money coming in every month. And it started turning into a real
problem. So, after twelve weeks of the “pay a charity period,” I
asked them to pay me instead. I was the charity now . Ha. I worried
they’d be upset to pay me instead, but they didn’ t seem to mind.
 
Once they got results, I asked them to send their friends over . T o
my surprise, I got another five or six clients from their referrals. I
asked the referrals to pay me directly . Again, none of them minded.
That little business made about $4000 per month and replaced the
income from my first job. It gave me enough money to live on (and
some). My savings started to grow again. Sigh of relief.
 
If this business sounds straightforward, that’ s because it was. I
emailed clients their plans and they texted me the questions they
had along the way . That’ s about it.
 
So if you’re starting, you don’ t need a lot. All you need is a tax ID,
a bank account, a way to take payments, and a way to
communicate with people.
 
But, that last part - a way to communicate with people - is the most
important part. It's how you get leads. So even though I had no
idea I was doing warm reach outs, one of the cor e four , it’ s how I
got my first leads. I still  get leads this way (just with bigger
numbers). And I’ll show you how you can too.
 
 
How W arm Reach Outs W ork
 

 
W arm reach outs are when you make one-to-one contact with your
warm audience - aka - the people who know you. It’ s the cheapest
and easiest way to find people interested in the stuf f you sell. It’ s
super ef fective–and most businesses don’ t do it. Don’ t be like most
businesses. Also, you do  have a warm audience, even if you don’ t
know it. Everybody knows somebody . So your personal contacts
are the easiest place to start.
 
W arm reach outs usually come in the form of calls, texts, emails,
direct messages, voicemails, etc. And like we learned in Section II,
you advertise one of two things. Y ou let them know about your
lead magnet (something free and valuable), or you let them know
about your core of fer (the main thing you sell).
 
When you start doing warm reach outs, you don’ t get many
engaged leads for your time. Y ou do everything on your own and
make each message personal. But, for that reason, it is r eliable . As
certain as the sun rises and sets,  it works .
 
Note:  Reaching out to your warm audience works whether you
have 100 contacts or 1,000,000. So as your business grows, you
will use automation and employees to make it more ef ficient. The
systems start small, with you, but they scale all the way up.  I detail
how to scale these systems to lar ger audiences in Section IV .
 

How T o Do W arm Reach Outs in 10 Steps
 
W arm reach outs are a fantastic way to get your “First Five
Clients” For any new pr oduct or service. Advanced Folks: Think
re-engagement and new product lines. Here’ s how to do it:
 
Step 1: Get your list
 
Step 2: Pick a platform
 
Step 3: Personalize your message
 
Step 4: Reach out
 
Step 5: W arm them up
 
Step 6: Invite their friends
 
Step 7:  Make them the easiest of fer in the world
 
Step 8: Start at the top
 
Step 9:  Start Char ging
 
Step 10:  Keep Y our List W arm
 
 
(Step 1) “But I don’t have any leads…” → Everyone Has A
List

 
 
Y ou know other humans. Let me prove it to you.
 
Grab your phone. Inside you have contacts. Each contact has
subscribed to communication fr om you . They have given you the
means and permission  to contact them.
 
Pull up all  the email accounts you’ve used over the years. Pull
your contacts and address list from each. Bingo! Look at all
them leads.
 
Now , go to all your social media profiles. See your followers,
subscribers, friends, connections, or whatever kids call ‘em
these days...eureka – you got more leads!
 
Add up all  your contacts from all  the platforms. Seriously , figur e
out the number .  Between your phone, email, social media, and
other platforms you will have more than enough contacts to get
started. For many of you, this will be your first 1000 leads. W ould
ya look at that! “I don’ t have any leads.” Psh. Just found some.
 
And if you’r e terrified you’ll have to talk to people. Relax. Y ou’ll
like what I’m gonna show you next.
 
 

(Step 2) “But I don’t know wher e to start…” → Pick A
Platform
 
Pick the platform you have the most contacts on. Phone, email,
social media, mail, carrier pigeon, etc. It doesn’ t matter . Just pick
the one with the most contacts. Y ou’ll hit ‘em all eventually
anyways.
 
 
(Step 3) “But what do I say?” → Personalize your gr eeting
 
Use something you know about the contact as your actual reason to
reach out. If you don’ t have much personal info, you can check
their social media profiles etc. to learn a bit about them first.
 
Don’ t be a weirdo. Pay your social dues. Remember , you haven’ t
asked for anything. Y ou’re just checking in and providing value.
So…r elax .
 
Ex: Saw you just had a baby! Congrats! How is the baby doing?
How ar e you?
 
 
(Step 4) “Now what?” → Reach. Out. T o. One. Hundr ed.
People. Every . Day .
 
“T o get what you want, you have to deserve what you want.” -
Charlie Munger
 
Now , reach out to 100 of them per day with your personalized
messages. Y ou’ll call, text, email, message, send a postcard, etc.

And you will reach out to them up to three times. Once per day for
three days* or until they respond. Whichever comes first.
 
*Once per week with physical mail.
 
 
 
(Step 5): “What do I say when they r espond?” → Act like a
human.
 
Now we can br eak the ice without sounding icky .
 
Reply using the A - C - A  framework:
 
A cknowledge  what they said. Restate it in your own words. This
shows active listening. 
 
Ex: T wo kids. And you’r e an accountant… 
 
C ompliment  them on whatever they tell you. T ie it to a positive
character trait if you can. 
 

Ex: …W ow! Supermom! So har dworking! Managing a
full-time car eer and two kids...
 
A sk  another question. Lead the conversation in whatever
direction you want. In this case, to a topic closer to your of fer .
Examples:
 
Therapy/Life Coaching: … Do you get time for yourself?
 
Fitness/W eight Loss: ... Do you have time to get workouts
in?
 
Cleaning Services: ... Do you have anyone who helps you
keep the house tidy?  
 
The ACA  framework is great because it helps you talk to anyone.
It just so happens it’ s also  useful for letting people know about
your stuf f. This means you can learn about the person and  guide
the conversation toward your of fer .
 
People love talking about themselves. So let them. They also love
to be complimented, so do that too. And if people feel good when
talking to you, they’ll like and trust you more. Y ou want people to
like and trust you mor e.  Besides, it’ s solid practice to find the good
in everyone anyway . Speaking of practice, this will take practice.
And that’ s OK.
 

 
 
(Step 6) “How do I know if they’r e inter ested?” → Make them
an offer .
 
Get through a ‘normal’ amount of conversation. Think 3-4
exchanges if on the phone or messaging and 3-4 minutes if in
person. Then, you’ll make them an of fer to see if they’re
interested.
 
When I make an of fer from scratch, I refer to the value equation. If
you’re wondering ‘what’ s the value equation?’ - it was the core
concept of my first book $100M Offers.  V alue, as I define it, has
four elements:
 
 

1) Dream Outcome : what the person wants to happen, the way they
want it to happen
 
State the best possible results your product can get. Big bonus
points if those results come from people like the one you’re
talking to.
 
2) Perceived Likelihood of Achievement : how likely they think it
is for them to achieve their goal
 
Include results, reviews, awards, endorsements, certifications,
and other forms of 3r d party validation. Also, guarantees are
huge.
 
3) T ime Delay : how long they believe it’ll take to get results after
they buy 
 
Describe how fast people start  getting results, how often they
get results when they start, and how long it takes to get the best
results possible.
 
4) Ef fort and Sacrifice : The bad stuf f they'll have to endure and the
good stuf f they'll have to give up in their struggle to get the result.
 
Show them the good stuf f they can keep doing, or get to do, and
still get results. And show them the bad stuf f that they can get
rid of, or avoid doing, and still get results. 
 
The goal is to maximize the first two and minimize the second two.
So all you have to do now is show someone:
 
Y ou have exactly what they want
 

They’re guaranteed to get it
 
Insanely fast 
 
W ithout lifting a finger or giving up anything they love 
 
No biggie, right? Obviously , that’ s ideal. W e gotta get as close to
that as we can without lying or exaggerating. 
 
So let’ s do just that with a real-life of fer:
 
...By the way , do you know anybody  who is  (describe their
struggles) looking to  (dream outcome) in  (time delay) ?  I’m taking
on five case studies for fr ee, because that’ s all I can handle. I just
want to get some testimonials for my service/pr oduct. I help them
(dream outcome) without  (ef fort and sacrifice). It works. I even
guarantee people get  (dream outcome) or I work with them until
they do. I just had a girl named XXX work with me  (dream
outcome) even though she  (describe the same struggle your contact
has). I also had another guy who  (dream outcome) and it was his
first time. I’d just like mor e testimonials to show it works acr oss
differ ent scenarios. Does anyone you like come to mind?  (Pause if
on the phone) …and if they say no… Haha, well…does anyone you
hate  come to mind?  (ha) This helps break any awkwardness.
 

 
There’ s an important feature here. W e’r e not asking them to buy
anything. W e’r e asking if they know anyone .  And of the people
who say yes, most say they  are interested. This entire thing is
engineered to boost their  perceived likelihood of achievement. It’ s
why we show struggles and  results from people like them who
have struggles like theirs. But, we let them  connect the dots. Since
you didn’ t ask them to buy anything, you don’ t come of f as pushy .
Some people will show interest in your stuf f. Some will refer you
to those who might. Some will do both. In all three outcomes, you
win. And you win without pushing anything on anyone.
 
If you have even less time or space to deliver it, just use the value
elements back to back:
 
I help  (ideal customer) get  (dream outcome) in  (time period)
without  (ef fort and sacrifice) and  (increase perceived likelihood of
achievement–look at the pro tip below).

 
Note: These work well for emails, texts, direct messages, calls, and
in-person. Just fill in the blanks.
 
 
 

 
 
(Step 7) “How do I get them to say yes?” → Make it easy for
them to say yes. Make it fr ee.
 

 
After people show interest, make your of fer easy to say yes to. I
like to start with the easiest of fer enhancer in the world - FREE:
 
And don’ t try to look advanced if you’re not. People aren’ t dumb.
Just be honest and keep it simple:
 
Since I’m only taking on five people, I can give you all the
attention you need to get brag-worthy r esults. And I’ll give it all
for fr ee so long as you pr omise to: 1) Use it 2) Give me feedback
and 3) Leave a killer r eview if you think it deserves one. Does that
sound fair? 
 
This sets reasonable expectations upfront.  And boom. Now , you’re
just helping people for free. W inning.
 

 
My recommendation - whenever you launch a new product or
service - make the first five free . The exact number matters less
than knowing why you benefit from it. Here’ s why:
 
1 . Y ou get the reps in and become comfortable with making of fers
to people. It’ll calm your nerves knowing you’re just helping…
for free…for now (winky face). 
 
2 . Y ou probably suck (for now). People are far more for giving
when you haven’ t char ged anything.
 
3 . Because you probably suck, you need to learn how to suck less.
Y ou suck less by doing more.  It’ s better to have a few guinea
pigs to get the kinks out. Y ou’ll learn a ton from the people you
help for free, I promise. Even though it may not feel like it now ,
you’re getting the better end of the deal. 
 
4 . If people get value, especially for free, they’re far more likely
to:

 
a . Leave positive reviews and testimonials.
 
b . Give you feedback.
 
c . Send their friends and family .
 
And if that’ s not awesome enough, free customers can make you
money in three other ways:
 
1)  They convert into paying customers.
 
2)  They send you paying customers via referrals.
 
3)  Their testimonials bring in paying customers. 
 
 
So no matter what, you win.
 

 
What if they say no?
 
Often, the most expensive part of what you sell isn’ t the price–it's
the hidden costs. Hidden costs  are the time, ef fort, and sacrifice it
takes to get results from the thing you sell. In other words, the
bottom part of the value equation . If you struggle to give your stuf f
away for free, it means either people don’ t want it (dream
outcome), they don’ t believe you (perceived likelihood of
achievement) or  the hidden costs (time, ef fort and sacrifice) are too
high. In short, your ‘free’ stuf f is too expensive . So figure out the
hidden costs. Once you do, you unlock even more value–that
you’ll eventually be able to char ge for .
 
T o build your understanding of hidden costs… ask.  So when
someone says “no” ask “why?”:
 
“What would I have to do to make it worth it for you to continue?”
 
Their answers give you a chance to solve their problem. And if you
solve that problem, they’ll probably buy from you. And even if

they don’ t buy from you, they’ll give you the ammo to get the next
person to.
 
And remember , failure is a requisite for success. It’ s part of the
process. So rack up failures as fast as you can. Get them out of the
way to start paying down your “no tax.” If you get thousands of
nos, you will get your yeses, I promise. I always tell myself: Y eses
give me opportunity . Nos give me feedback. Either way , I win.
 
 

 
 
(Step 8) “What Do I Do Once I’ve Reached Out T o Everyone?”
→ Start Back At The T op
 
 
After reaching out to all the leads on one platform, switch to the
platform you have the second most leads on. After you reach out to
those leads, go to the platform you have the third most leads on
and so forth.
 
Let’ s say you follow this to the tee because being poor sucks more
than helping people for free. If between all platforms, you have
1000 leads, that gives you ten solid days of work. A month of work

including follow-ups. By this point, I promise, five or mor e people
will have accepted your fr ee offer .  And some will have converted
into paying customers. If you did a good job, they’ll send friends,
and they’ll become paying customers too.
 
So, let’ s make our first dollar .
 
 
(Step 9) “But I can’t work for fr ee for ever…” → Start
Charging.
 
 
This is important. This is your litmus test to know when you’re
“good enough” to char ge. Once people start r eferring, start
char ging .  When that happens, swap out ‘… fr ee…’  in the script
above to ‘80% off  for the next five’. Then ‘ 60% off  for the next
five.’ Then ‘ 40% off  for the next five,’ and so forth. The “I
increase my prices every five” rule also adds ur gency because
prices actually  go up. And if you’re curious, you don’ t have to stop
raising your price. Feel free to keep raising it by 20% every five
until you find your sweet spot. It’ s your business. Y ou can do what
you want. Char ge more as you get more experienced - a nice
reward.
 

 
 
(Step 10) “But what do I do fr om her e?” →Keep your list
warm.

 
Give regular value to your list through email, social media, etc. to
keep it warm. A warm list stays primed for your warm reach outs
in the future. W e cover exactly how to give that value in the next
chapter . Once you’ve given value for a while, or see who wants
value, probe your list with Dean Jackson's timeless "9-word email"
template”:
 
Ar e you still looking to [4 wor d desir e]?
 
No images. No frills. No links. Just a question. Nothing else. This
message is money for getting leads to engage. And it’ s among the
first things I do when I invest in a new business. Here are a few
examples:
 
Ar e you still looking to
 
…buy your dr eam home?
 
…get mor e sales leads?
 
…tone up your arms?
 
…open an online stor e?
 
…start a Y ouT ube channel?
 
Y ou get the idea. Swipe and deploy . Y ou make the ask to see who
replies - aka - engaged leads. And these r eplies should be your top
priority for warm r each outs.

 
I’ll end step 10 here because I break down this “give-ask” process
in the next chapter . The main point is that a warm list is a huge
asset because it’ s a consistent and gr owing  source of engaged
leads. If you treat them well, your audience will feed you forever .
 
 
Advertising Checklist Summary
 
Now let’ s look at this in ten lines because it took ten pages to get
here.
 
 
Benchmarks: How well am I doing?
 

 
W arm reach outs should get about one in five contacts to engage.
So one hundred warm reach outs should get about twenty replies.
Of the twenty who reply , another one in five ish  will take you up on
your free of fer . So, four people. Of the four who take your free
of fer now , you should be able to convert one  into some sort of paid
of fer later . Hooray - money .
 
This framework allows you to predict how many customers you
get per 100 warm reach outs. In the example, you would get one
customer per 100 reach outs. These numbers vary based on the
value of your of fer and how much they trust you. But, no matter
what, with enough volume,  you will get a customer . And the more
you do it, the better your numbers will get. It just takes ef fort.
Y ou’ll also learn a lot about what engages your audience: what
they value and how to make of fers to them. This knowledge can
make you millions. Y ou get to learn while you earn - score.
 
This process alone  can take you to $100,000+ per year with
nothing else. W ild, I know . Here’ s the money math:
 
This assumes 1% of your list buys a $400 of fer using  only  warm
reach outs.
 

500 reach outs per week = 5 customers per week
 
$400 product → 5 customers per week x $400 each = $2000/wk
 
$2000/wk x 52 weeks = $104,000…bingo.
 
Which, as of this writing, is still two times the median household
income in the US. Not bad.
 
 
 
Y ou’ll learn more in the first ten days of doing  100 reach outs than
you did from everything you’ve ever read or watched. Get that

learning done as fast as you can. Remember , we want to get rich,
not just “get by .”
 
 
What’ s Next?
 
W arm reach outs have two limitations.
 
The first is time. When you're starting out, getting new customers
should take the majority of your time. Think four hours per day ,
minimum. It should be the first thing you do when you get up. And
you shouldn’ t stop until you achieve your goal. Embrace the work.
It will be part of the story you tell one day . It has been for me.
 
The second limiter is the number of people who know you. Y ou’ll
eventually “run out.” Don’ t worry though. W e can get more. A lot
more. Now we add  the second of the core four advertising
activities: posting free content.
