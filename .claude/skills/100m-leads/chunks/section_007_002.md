engaged leads. Period. Now , we are crystal clear on the stuf f you
do (the core four). And like we learned when maximizing the core
four–Y ou just gotta put in mor e  and do it better than before. W e
started with the rule of 100–but when you make that the norm,
you’re ready to take it to the next level with…
 
 
Rule of 100 on Ster oids–Open T o Goal

 
A very successful gym chain allowed their sales managers to make
their own schedules. But there was a catch–they had to sign up five
new members per day  no matter what.  So if they did it by lunch,
they could cut out early . But if it took 18 hours, so be it. They
called this type of work schedule ‘open-to-goal’.
 
I’ve found that elite entrepreneurs and salespeople across
industries do some variation of ‘open to goal’. This is because it’ s
like the rule of 100… but for the big kids. Y ou don’ t just commit to
doing something a specific number of times… you commit to the
work until you hit a specific number of outcomes–no matter what.
So it means you unlock a whole new level of ef fort you never even
realized you had. It might mean only doing something fifty times
to get the desired result. Or , like the flyers, five thousand times,
every day , for years .
 
If you want to take your advertising to the next level - work until
the job is done.  Give up the idea of ‘doing your best.’ Instead, do
what is required. And sometimes that means your best just needs to
get better .
 
 
How I Make Open T o Goal W ork For Myself
 
 

If I had to pick the three habits that best served me in my life - they
would be:
 
1) W aking up early (4-5 am) –Pro tip, this actually means  going to
bed early …
 
2) Getting right to work –No rituals. No routines. I drink cof fee and
get to work.
 
3) No meetings until noon –No interruptions. Nothing. Fully
focused work time.
 
T o be clear , I don’ t think there’ s any magic to waking up early . But
I do think there’ s magic in a long stretch of uninterrupted work
immediately after a long stretch uninterrupted sleep. After all, it’ s
the most productive hours in a row of the most productive work I
can do… with nothing getting in my way… Every . Single. Day .
How can you lose?
 
And since I have a good idea of what I can do in a day , I set my
daily goal accordingly . Then, only after my dedicated block of
work–do I go put out fires, talk to humans, and deal with the other
day to day stuf f.
 
W aking up early , getting right to work, and working 8 hours
straight has been my highest ROI “habit stack.” By a longshot. If
you choose to try it, I hope it serves you as well as it has served me
(or better). And for those of you thinking “W ait! That’ s more than
twelve hours of work a day!” Y ou’re right. I’m playing to win. But
if it overwhelms you at first, I get it. Just throttle it back a few
hours and then work your way up. Some days it’ s tough, but I
always like to remind myself:
 

“Do mor e than they do, and you will have mor e than they have.”
 
Since my job is usually to “get more customers” in most of my
companies, advertising is what I focus on. This book, for example,
was written exclusively in that open to goal time block. Why?
Because it’ s an asset that can bring me more companies.
 
So, if you’re gonna follow my high ROI habit stack, then you’re
gonna want a clear action plan for that time. This is the simplest
advertising plan I can give you.

Conclusion
 
Lots of pages. So many ideas. W e’re almost at the end. But, you
don’ t have any more leads. What gives? Answer: Reading doesn’ t
get people interested in the stuf f you sell… advertising does. If
you’re not telling anyone about the stuf f you sell, then you aren’ t
getting anyone interested in the stuf f you sell. Period.
 
This chapter laid out the plan to advertise in the simplest way I
could:
 
W ork ‘open to goal.’
 
Structure your day to make open to goal possible.
 
Create and  commit to that goal with the one page advertising 
checklist. 
 
Many skip planning, or worse, they write a one hundred page plan
that never gets used. So skip the atrocious waste of time that is
writing pages of baloney . Harness the power of laying out your
action steps on a single page . It leaves little room for excuses,
distractions, and delusions. Y ou either did the stuf f or you didn’ t.
Y ou can fill out your one page advertising checklist in about five

minutes. And once the naked truth stares back at you, all you have
left is to do it .

Zero to $100,000,000

T o get to where you want to go, it pays to know what lies ahead.
So in this chapter , I describe the phases you will go through as you
scale your advertising. Acquisition.com uses this roadmap to scale
our portfolio companies from a few million a year , all the way to
$100,000,000+. These levels will help you identify where you are
on the advertising totem pole so you know what to do to get to the
next level.
 
Level 1: Y our friends know about the stuff you sell.  T o start getting
engaged leads, you make one of fer , to one avatar , on one platform.
The moment you get engaged leads, is the moment you can start
making money . For me, this started with reaching out to everyone  I
knew .

 
Primary Action : W arm outreach.
 
Level 2:  Y ou  consistently  let everyone you know  about the stuff you
sell. Y ou know the exact inputs to get an engaged lead with your
chosen advertising method. And, by scaling those inputs, you get
consistent  customers with it. But the consistent customers come
from maximizing your personal work capacity . For me, on top of
warm reach outs, I maximized my personal work capacity with
paid aids, using a case study as my lead magnet. But looking back,
I wish I would have started with posting free content. So I suggest
that.
 
Primary Actions:  Do as much warm outreach and post as much
content as you can consistently .
 
Level 3: Y ou  get employees to help you do mor e advertising.
Y ou’ve maxed your personal advertising inputs, but not the
platform. And if you want more engaged leads that can only mean
one thing. Doing more. For me, I hired a videographer and a media
buyer to take most of the paid ads work of f my plate.
 
Primary Action:  Y ou hire people to advertise profitably on your
behalf.
 
Level 4 : Y our pr oduct is good enough to get consistent r eferrals.
Y ou continue building goodwill and shoot for getting 25% or more
of your customers from referrals. Now , you’ve set yourself up to
ramp your advertising again. But to make that work, you have to
get more serious about hiring a team to make it happen.
 
This is when I realized that my ads were shut of f but I was still
getting referrals every week. So, I doubled down on referrals. I

built goodwill using customer feedback to update my product
every two weeks.  I also started a strong referral program with big
incentives at the same time.
 
Primary Actions:  Focus on your product until you get consistent
referrals then go back to scaling your advertising with a bigger
team. This is where most people mess up. They let their product
slip and never recover .
 
Level 5:  Y ou  advertise in mor e places in mor e ways with mor e
people.  First, you expand to new audiences on your best platform.
Then, you make ads with all placements and media types the
platform supports. And, after your team can get consistent results,
you expand your team again to add: another platform, lead-getter ,
or cor e four activity .
 
For me, I hit two birds with one stone. I expanded my paid ads to
include potential af filiates. And this paved the way for my af filiate
programs.
 
Primary Action : Advertise profitably using at least two methods on
multiple platforms.
 
Level 6: Y ou  hir e killers. Y our executives grow departments
specific to an advertising method or platform without you. And
you're not looking for potential. Y ou're looking for experienced
leaders specializing in exactly what you want. W e capped here.
 
It took me three years to figure out two things. One, that I needed
veteran executives with experience suited to my problems. And
two, that they needed stronger incentives. But by the time I
realized this, I sold those companies. Once I started
Acquisition.com I realized the power of expanding the pie to get

more of the right people invested in winning. This is how we
crossed $100M+ then $200M+ in portfolio revenue and beyond.
 
Primary Action : Get battle-hardened executives and department
heads to take over new advertising activities and channels.
 
 
 
Level 7:  I’ll come back and edit this chapter once I cross a billion.
I promise, I’ll send the lessons as soon as I have them. Y ou have
my word.
 
Last Points : I know this looks clean. But it never is. Real business
is messy . It takes a lot  to find what audiences, lead magnets,
methods, and platforms work best. And you can only find out what
works if you try . So you have to try a lot of dif ferent things, a lot of
dif ferent ways, for a long enough time to know for sure.
 

Nobody  can ever know the absolute best thing to do. But I do know
this: the more you advertise, the more people find out about the
stuf f you sell. The more people who know about the stuf f you sell,
the more people will buy it. This is the key to the $100M Leads
Machine.
 
 
The $100M+ Lead Machine
 
 
Let’ s look into your future. Y our business makes $100,000,000+
annual revenue. It’ s great to have a clear picture of what the
$100M machine looks like. Let’ s have a look, shall we? First and
foremost, your advertising fires on all cylinders…
 
Y our media team scales tons of free content, in all media types,
on many platforms.
 
Y ou regularly make of fers to your warm audience to get more
customers or af filiates.
 
Y our ravenous audience makes anything  you launch immediately
profitable.
 
Y ou have teams running and scaling profitable paid ads across
multiple platforms. 
 

Y our cold outreach team gets you more customers.
 
Y ou have an af filiate manager launching and integrating all new
af filiates.
 
Y ou have recruiters and  recruiting agencies bringing in more
lead getters.
 
Y our product is so good that a third of your customers bring you
more customers.
 
Y our executive team drives all this growth without you.
 
And… you have mor e engaged leads than you can possibly
handle.
