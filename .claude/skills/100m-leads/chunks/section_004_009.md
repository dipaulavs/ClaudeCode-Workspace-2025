“If at first you don’ t succeed, use for ce.”
 
 
I surveyed the fifty or so faces of the group. All entrepreneurs
looking to scale their businesses. Each hungry for the “missing
link”  that would flood them with engaged leads. After finishing a
presentation on lead generation, I opened up the floor for Q&A :
 
The first business owner chimed in, “I just feel like I’ve saturated
the market. I don't think we can get any bigger in the chiropractor
niche than we already are.”
 
“What’re you doing in revenue?” I asked.
 
“$2,000,000 a year”
 
“And how much do you spend on advertising?”
 
“About $30,000 a month on Facebook”
 
“What’ s your conversion rate from click to close?”
 

“I don’ t know”
 
“So you don’ t track overall throughput?”
 
“I guess not.”
 
“Okay…What other platforms do you advertise on?”
 
“None.”
 
“How much content do you make for chiropractors?”
 
“None.”
 
“How much cold outreach do you do?”
 
“None.”
 
“And the $30k you spend, on one platform, for a two million dollar
business, saturated the $15.1B chiropractor industry? Does that
sound reasonable?”
 
A second business owner chimed in before he could answer "If it
helps - I'm in the chiropractor niche too, and I spent $30k in
advertising, across four  platforms, last week... "
 
“Do you still feel like you’ve saturated your niche?” I asked.
 
 He got the point.

I have this conversation daily with entrepreneurs looking to grow .
T ypically , they have figured out how to get enough customers from
one  platform to get them to $1M-$3M per year . It’ s still not
completely predictable. And they have their ups and downs. But
they have the “gist” of what they need to do and have seen some
success. So it’ s at this point they hit a wall because they think they
can't make more money . They assume they’ve “tapped” their
market. I kid you not. I had a conversation with a dif ferent
entrepreneur making about $3,000,000 per year in the weight loss
space. He worried increasing his ad spend past $40,000 per month
would saturate his ad platform. For context, that platform has over
1B active daily users. And he was selling weight loss… in
America…  a $60B industry . Silly .
 
There are more leads out there than you can possibly imagine. I’ve
used a framework to unlock those leads over and over again and
now you can use it too.
 
 
How T o Get Even Mor e Leads: Mor e Better New
 
First, you reach out to people who know you. Then, you start
making free content. Then you start reaching out to people who
don’ t know you. Then you start running paid ads. This is how you
do  the core four to get engaged leads. And there’ s really nothing
else a single person can do on their own  to get them.
 
But what if you are doing the core four and still not getting as
many engaged leads as you want? W ell, worry not! There are two
ways to boost any  of the core four to get even more engaged leads

on your own . I use these every time I want to increase the engaged
lead flow in a portfolio company . They are easy to remember:
Mor e, Better , New .
 
Simply stated:
 
1)  Y ou can do mor e  of what you’re currently doing. 
 
2)  Y ou can do what you’re currently doing better .
 
3)  Y ou can do it somewhere new .
 
And, just like the story in the beginning with the agency owner ,
that's  exactly what I was asking him . Could you advertise more?
Could you advertise better? Could you advertise somewhere new?
 
So let’ s start with the one I actually do first: Mor e .
 
Mor e
 
 
Y ou’ve done some advertising by now . And you know the
advertising that you do works to some degree. So the next obvious
thing you can do to get more engaged leads is - mor e . A lot mor e.
Crank up the volume to your max capacity .

 
Even with no improvements at all, if you double your inputs,
you’ll get more engaged leads. Make twice the reach outs, post
twice the content, run twice the ads, double the ad spend, etc. Y ou
won’ t regret it. Unless, of course, you hate money .
 
So while we’ll always focus on testing to make ourselves better ,
which we’ll get to in a moment,  the biggest  increases often come
from advertising mor e .
 
 
Here’ s how I do mor e : The Rule of 100
 
The rule of 100 is simple. Y ou advertise your stuf f by doing 100
primary actions every day , for one hundred days in a row . That’ s it.
I don't make many promises, but this is one. If you do 100 primary
actions per day , and you do it for 100 days straight, you will get
more engaged leads. Commit to the rule of 100 and you will never
go hungry again.
 
Here’ s what it looks like applied to each of the core four:
 
W arm Reach Outs:
100 reach outs per day
 
Example primary actions: email, text, direct message, calls, etc.
 
Post Content:
 
100 minutes per day making content.

 
Release at least one per day on a platform. As you get better , post
even more.
 
Example primary actions: short and long videos or articles,
podcasts, infographics, etc.
 
Cold Reach Outs:
 
100 reach outs per day
 
Example primary actions: email, text, direct message, cold call,
flyers, etc.
 
As with all cold advertising, expect lower r esponse rates, so use
automation.
 
Paid Ads:
 
100 minutes per day making paid ads
 
Example primary actions: direct response media ads, direct mail,
seminar , podcast spots, etc.
 
100 days straight of running those paid ads. Use the daily budget
we calculated together in the paid ads chapter . Aim for Client
Financed Acquisition.
 

 
Her e’ s some inspiration fr om someone in #Mozination following
the rule of 100:
 
 
 
Better
 

 
Getting better gets you more leads for the same ef fort. W e want
that. And you can only get better by doing one thing–testing. So
you do more and more… until it br eaks . Then, you make it better .
In other words, if you do mor e for long enough, your CAC will
eventually get too high to sustain. So you make a tweak and see if
it improves. If it does, keep doing it. If it doesn’ t, toss it out.
Thousands of these tiny tests separate the winners from the
beginners.
 
Every action a lead takes before they become a customer is a
potential “drop-of f” point. So I do the most testing at whatever step
the most leads dr op off.  I call these “constraints.” Constraints are
the points where the smallest improvements create the biggest
boost in results. That's why they're so important. W e get the
biggest bang for our buck. For example, if you have three steps in
your process:
 
30% Optin (give you their contact information)
 
5% Apply ← This is the constraint because it has the biggest drop-
of f
 
50% Schedule
 

But let’ s ignore the constraint for a moment. Imagine we improve
each step by 5% by itself.
 
30 + 5%→35% Optin = 16% Increase in leads (1.16x)
 
5 + 5%→10% Apply = 100% Increase in leads (2x)
 
50 + 5%→55% Schedule = 10% Increase in leads (1.1x)
 
 
W e get wildly dif ferent results! Improving the constraint also
comes out the clear winner . So, focus on the constraint.  And,
again, if you’re not sure which step is the biggest constraint, find
the step where the most leads drop of f. Y ou’ll get the biggest
reward for the smallest improvement.
 
Here’ s how I get better : I test one thing per week per platform . And
I do it for four big reasons.
 
1)  If you test multiple things at a time on one platform you never
really learn what worked.
 
2)  Steps af fect each other . A single change can af fect results at
other steps. For example, if you change step one, and more
people optin, but fewer  people apply , no bueno. But you
wouldn’ t know that if you changed both steps. If you make one
change you can see what happened . If you make a bunch of
changes…good luck trying to figure out what worked (or
didn’ t).
 
3)  It forces you to prioritize what will get you the most engaged
leads. Y ou can do an infinite amount of tests. But, time is

limited. So you must choose your tests wisely . For example, if
you only do one “big” test per week per platform, don’ t waste it
on a color change from red to bright red.
 
4)  Maybe the most important, you run the test for long enough to
see if you actually get an improvement. T oo short and you won’ t
get enough data. T oo long and you waste time you could’ve
spent improving the next constraint. W ith the size of my team
and the amount of money I spend on advertising, one week is
typically long enough for me.
 
In every company I own, I set up a testing schedule. Every
Monday we run one split test per platform. W e give it a week. And
the next Monday , we do three things:
 
1)  Look at the results, and pick the winners for each platform test.
 
2)  Then (important), we write down the results of the test in a log
of all tests. So the next time we do something, we start a zillion
improvements later , not at square one.
 
3)  Come up with our next test to beat our current ‘best’ version. If
we can’ t beat the version we’re currently running in four tries
(or one month) , we move onto the next constraint.
 
Y ou continue to allocate ef fort to make things better . But, at a
certain point, the ef fort you put into making it better brings lower
and lower returns. At some point, it makes more sense to invest
your ef fort into something that will bring higher returns. Only at
this point, do we try something new .
 

 
 
 
New

 
So after you’ve improved your marketing ef forts through ‘more’
and ‘better ’ the only thing you have left is - ‘new places in new
ways.’ In simple terms– new . And if you think your business can’ t
possibly get any bigger , let me show you why  it can. Then, I’ll
show you how  it can.
 
 
Most business owners look only at the platform and tiny
community they market in. And usually , there are only three or
four big companies marketing in their niche. So, they assume those
companies must  split the entir e  market between them. This is
exactly what the entrepreneur in my intro story did. Think for a
moment about how ridiculous this is. I call this problem: The Size
Of The Pie Fallacy . Here’ s a drawing to illustrate how the market
is, in fact, much bigger than most assume.
 

 
The  Size Of The Pie Fallacy . A small  business uses one of the
core four , on one platform, in one specific way , with a very
tar geted audience. And in that same  space, advertising the same
way , there may only be a handful of other competitors.
 
They mistakenly assume the tiny  slice of the universe they
advertise to is the entire available market! This is why most
businesses stay small. When they plateau, they think there’ s no
more leads to get. They believe they got as big as they possibly
can. Because, for many , saying "I'm as big as I can get" is much
easier than saying "I’m not as good at advertising as I thought.”
This false ar gument keeps entrepreneurs everywhere poorer than
they should be.
 
When to do new : When the returns you get from doing
more↔better are lower than what you could get from a new
placement or new way of advertising.
 
There are many other slices of attention (and potential leads)
sitting just inside the tiny universe of “post content .” They could
add new placements  (since many platforms have multiple places

and forms of content). For example, on Instagram you can make
stories, messenger ads, and posts. On Y ouT ube you can make
shorts, longs, community posts, etc. Or , they could add a new
platform . They go from Instagram messenger to Facebook
messenger . They go from Y ouT ube shorts videos to Instagram
short videos (reels). Etc. And once they’ve exhausted those, they
could add an entirely new core four  activity .
 
And if you're curious, the order I pick my next ‘new’ comes down
to one thing: what will get me the most leads for the amount of
work? That is the rule. And nine times out of ten, it goes like this:
 
New placements→New Platforms→New Core Four .
 
Bottom Line : No matter how you advertise, you could do it in new
ways (dif ferent styles of content) or in new places (think other
platforms). Then finally , do a new core four activity altogether .
And, you guessed it, each of them gets us what we want - more
leads.
 
Now , this is much harder in practice, which is why I exhaust
‘more, better ’ first. But at a certain point you have to expand to
‘new’ placements, platforms, and core four activities to let more
people know about your stuf f.
 
Action Step : Exhaust more better first. Once you can’ t do
anymore, any better ( meaning the returns are lower than putting
that same ef fort into a new platform ) try new . Use this rough order:

new placement, new platform, new core four activity . Get it going.
Measure how you do. And scale up from there using more–better .
Then, rinse and repeat.
 
 
‘Mor e Better New’ Summary
 
First, you do way mor e  of the advertising that works until it
“breaks.” Then, the next dr op off point becomes obvious . Then you
keep that level of advertising up while you go back, fix the
constraint, and make it better . So really , better  and mor e  work with
each other more than they work separately . The first question I
usually ask myself before we invest in a company that needs to get
more customers is “What’ s stopping them from doing ten times
what they’re currently doing?” Sometimes, nothing– so we just do
mor e . Other times we just need to make something better  first. So
answer that question and you’ll know what to do next.
 
Only once you’ve exhausted more–better do the real returns come
from doing new . First, go with new ad placements on a platform
you know . Second, go with placements you know on a new
platform. Then, once you get the hang of that new platform, use
new placements on it. Once you exhaust that, you can add a new
core four activity on top of what you currently do. That gives you
my simple, r eal-world way , I put the core four on steroids to get
even more leads.
 
 
Conclusion
 
Advertising  is the pr ocess of making known . It’ s what we do to let
strangers know about the stuf f we sell. Now , we solved ‘the stuf f ’
problem with your lead magnet or of fer . But to get them to turn

into engaged leads, you have to tell them about it . So we spent this
section going over the only four ways a single person  can
advertise–let other people know about their stuf f. And to do it, you
trade either time, money , or both. And when you do it, you can
advertise to people who know you (warm) or you can advertise to
strangers (cold). Y ou can advertise publicly (content/ads) or
privately (outreach).
 
As far as what to do when? Whenever I build a business I think
about it this way–after I do warm outreach to get my pool of
customers going–if I have more time than money , I move to
posting content. If I have more money than time, I go with cold
outreach or running ads.
 
But remember , you only need to do one  to get engaged leads. So,
just pick one . Then, max it out . Do more. Do better . Do new . And,
all the advertising methods compound together . The money ,
systems, and experience you earned from the prior method will
help you master the next. A business that posts free content and
runs paid ads will get more out of their ads and  their content than a
business that does only one or the other . A business that does cold
outreach and makes content will get more from their cold outreach
and  work their warm leads better than one that does only one.
Every combination of the core four advertising activities boost
each other in some way .
 
And as a personal note, I’ve done ‘em all. I built my first
business of f posting content and warm outreach. I built my gyms
of f free content and paid ads. I built Gym Launch of f paid ads and
cold outreach. I built Prestige Labs of f af filiates (which we cover
in Section IV). I built ALAN of f paid ads and af filiates (also
Section IV). I built Acquisition.com of f posting content. There are
many ways to get engaged leads. If you master one, you will be
able to feed yourself for the rest of your life. They all work if you
do.

 
 
Next Up
 
If you follow the steps in this book, you’ll run out of hours in the
day . Y ou won’ t be able to do any more, any better… let alone add
anything new! So you’ll need help on your journey to the land of
endless leads. Y ou’ll need allies. Those allies come in four
dif ferent flavors. And since there are more of them than there are
of you, they’re the key to getting there. So let’ s go get them.
