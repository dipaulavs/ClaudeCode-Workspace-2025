If it’ s fr ee, it’ s for me!
 
 
I’m gonna give you a bunch of free stuf f in a second - so stay
tuned.
 
Dr . Kashey (my editor) and I spent over 3,500 hours on this book.
W e wrote 650+ pages and 19 drafts with varying frames, themes,
and points of focus. But ultimately , the changes left only the most
distilled ‘need to knows’ inside. W e went through 127 pages of
hand drawn models to carve out the few that made it into the book.
All that to say - I hope this work results in you growing the
business of your dreams.
 

When I look back on my life these books will be among the things
I am most proud of. I wouldn’ t be able to write as fervently if I
didn’ t think people would read it. And as much as I strive to be the
man who would work as hard if nobody cared, I am not there yet.
Y our support and positivity make a dif ference for me. So thank you
from the bottom of my heart for allowing me to do the work I find
meaningful. I am forever grateful.
 
If you are new to #mozination, welcome. W e believe in big
ambitions, and matching our ambitions with giving and patience.
And I have a personal goal in that spirit of giving: to die with
nothing left to give .
 
So if you’re still with me, thank you. I want to provide some more
goodies.
 
1)  If you’r e struggling to figur e out  who  to sell to , I released a
chapter called “Y our First A vatar” between this book and the
last. Think of it like a ‘single’ from a music album. Y ou can get
it for free at Acquisition.com/avatar .  Just pop in your email
and we’ll send it over . 
 
2)  If you’r e struggling to figur e out what  to sell , you can go to
Amazon or wherever you buy books and search “Alex Hormozi”
and $100M Of fers. It should get you on the right path. The
digital version is available for sale at the cheapest price that the
platform would let me make it and still list it as a book. 
 
3)  If you’r e struggling with getting people to buy , my next book
will be on persuasion and sales.  It may or may not be out by
the time you read this. It’ll either be called $100M Sales or
Persuasion. I haven’ t decided yet. But if you search my name
you can look for any other books that may be out by the time

you read this. 
 
4)  If you want a job at Acquisition.com  or in one of our portfolio
companies - we love hiring from #mozination. W e love doing
this because we’ve found our best returns investing in great
people. Go to Acquisition.com/car eers/open-jobs , and you can
see all the job openings across all our companies and our
portfolio. 
 
5)  If your company is over $1M in EBITDA (pr ofit) , we’d love
to invest in your business to help you scale. It brings so much
pleasure to know our portfolio companies have grown much
bigger and faster than mine because they avoided the mistakes I
made . If you want us to take a look under the hood and see if we
can help go to Acquisition.com . Sending your info is fast and
easy .
 
6)  T o get the free book downloads and video trainings that come
with this book, go to Acquisition.com/training/leads .
 
7)  If you like listening to podcasts and want to hear mor e , my
podcast at the time of this writing is top 5 in entrepreneurship
and top 15 in business in the US. Y ou can get there by searching
“Alex Hormozi” wherever you listen. Or , by going to
Acquisition.com/podcast . I share useful and interesting stories,
valuable lessons, and the essential mental models I rely on every
day . 
 
8)  If you like to watch videos , we put a lot of resources into our
free training, available for everyone. W e intend on making it
better than any paid stuf f out there, and let you decide if we
succeeded. Y ou can find our videos on Y ouT ube or wherever
you watch videos by searching “Alex Hormozi”.
 

9)  And if you like short form videos , check out the bite sized
content we pump out on the daily at Acquisition.com/media .
Y ou’ll see all the places we post and you can pick the ones you
like the most.
 
And last, thank you again. Please be one of those givers and shar e
this with other entr epr eneurs by leaving a r eview . It would
mean the world to me. I’m sending you business building vibes
from my desk. I spend a lot of time there, so it’ s a lot of vibes. May
your desire be greater than your obstacles.
 
Hope to meet you and your company soon. Ad astra.
 
Alex Hormozi, Founder , Acquisition.com
