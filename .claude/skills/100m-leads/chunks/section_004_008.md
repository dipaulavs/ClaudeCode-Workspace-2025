“I’m just trying to buy a dolla’ and sell it for two” - Pr oposition
Joe, The W ir e
 
W e focus on ef ficiency with paid ads throughout this chapter and
the last one because efficiency matters mor e than cr eativity . All
advertising works. The only thing that dif fers between
advertisements is how well  they work. Maybe people get crazy
about making paid ads because they have words like “copy” and
“creative” and “media” then get hyper -focused on getting all that
stuf f “perfect” (as if you can). Y ou can tweak all day and night…
until the cows come home! The reality is that paid ads, any
advertising really , is all about  the r eturn on your investment. And
with paid ads it gets clear as day because you put X dollars in for
people to see the ad and get Y dollars out if they buy your stuf f. So
if you want a $100M leads  machine, you just need to get it "good
enough" to scale. Why? Because good enough is good enough.
 
Since ef ficiency matters most, we want to be as ef ficient as
possible so we can scale as much as possible. That way , we get as
many leads as our little heart’ s desire.
 
That being said, there’ s enough nuance to scaling paid ads that it
felt better to break it into its own chapter . This chapter answers
four big questions about ads as I understand them:
 
How much do I spend? →Three Phases of Scaling Ads
 
How do I know how well I’m doing? →Cost & Benchmarks
 

If my ads aren’ t profitable, how do I fix it? →Client Financed
Acquisition.
 
What do I wish I had known before I ran my first paid ad?
→Lessons
 
“But how much do I spend on paid ads?”→ The Thr ee Phases
of Scaling Paid Ads
 
There are three stages to spending money on ads as I see it.
 
Phase One:  T rack Money
 
Phase T wo:  Lose Money
 
Phase Three:  Print Money
 
Let’ s break them down together .
 
 
Phase One :  T rack Money .  Before spending a dollar on ads, set
everything up so you can accurately track your returns. If you
don’ t track, you’re gonna get cleaned out. It would be like going to
a casino and playing your favorite game for as long as you felt like
it rather than for as long as you could af ford it. But, once you have
tracking, you can do more of the stuf f that makes you money and
less of the stuf f that doesn't. It rigs the game in your favor . So get a
consultant, watch tutorials, and get it set up. End of story . Once
you have the tracking, you can start losing money like a pro
(wink).
 

Phase T wo : Lose money  (half-joking). I prefer to call it ‘investing
in a money printing machine.’ After all, when running paid ads,
you pay first. So your bank account has to go down before it comes
up.
 
I emphasize this because I'd rather prepare you: you’r e gonna lose
money . In fact, I've lost money more times  than I’ve made money
running paid ads. But every time I make money with paid ads, I
make back everything I lost, and then a bunch mor e. So the
number of times I lose is high but the amount I lose is low because
I know when to shut it down. And my number of wins is low but
the amount I win is very high because I know when to hit the gas.
So, think of it like this.
 
Imagine I spend $100 on ten ads - $1,000 in total. Nine of them
lose all $100. Then, one of them makes $500 back for the $100 I
spent. I’m still down $500. Many people stop here because they
see a $500 dollar loss. But not us. W e see a winner . So now we
buckle up and 100x down. W e spend $10,000 on the winning ad
and make $50,000 back.
 
Note: I still lost nine times , but the one time  I won, I won big. And
this is important, because you might lose, nine or ninety-nine times
in a row before you win big. But, to win big, you have to see the
winners and double, triple, quadruple, 10x down on them . This is
why paid advertising is a lot like a casino. Y ou’ll often lose in the
beginning to learn the game. But - with enough skill - you
eventually become the house. That being said, during this “lose
money” phase, you can still be smart about it. Here’ s how I do it.
 
I budget two times the cash I collect fr om a customer in thirty
days ( not  L TGP) when testing new ads.  I wasted tons of money
letting ads run too long before I realized they sucked. But on the
flipside, I’ve lost even more money by giving up on ads before I

gave them a chance. Eventually , I hit a sweet spot by budgeting
two times  the cash I collected from a new customer in the first
thirty days to test a new ad. For example, if I know I make $100 in
profit from a customer in the first thirty days, I’ll let an ad go up to
$200 in spend before shutting it of f (as long as I’m getting leads).
If I’m not getting any leads from an ad at all, before I spend 1x
thirty-day cash I shut it of f ($100 in the example).
 
It costs money to build an advertising machine . I worked with a
business that took a year to get paid ads profitable. It was tough.
But other businesses in their space ran profitable ads which meant
we could too . Once they were profitable, they made their year ’ s
worth of ‘wasted’ money back in the next  month . It costs money to
build an advertising machine…and that’ s normal . Just make sure
you measure the returns over a long time horizon, not next week.
Can you think of anything more valuable than a machine that
prints money? It would be unreasonable for it be cheap (or easy).
Once you start making more money than it costs you to make it,
you’re in phase three.
 
Phase Thr ee : Print Money .  If you’re making back more money
than you spend - the answer is simple - spend as much as you can .
After all, if you had a magic machine that gave you $10 for every
$1 you put into it, what would your budget be? Right. All the
money . But realistically , you probably have some other constraint
on your business that prevents you from unlimited customers
coming in. So here’ s how I scale my budget.
 
Instead of asking “How much money should I spend on an ad?” I
ask “How many customers do I want?” or “How many customers
can I handle?” So once ads break even or better , I reverse my
budget from my sales goals . If I can only handle 100 customers
next month, and customers cost me $100 to get, I‘d need to spend
$10,000 to get them (100 x $100). But since ads get less ef ficient
as they scale, I usually pad the budget by twenty percent. So that

means $12,000 over thirty days, or $400 per day in ad spend. I
reverse my daily ad budget from my lead-getting goal. Then, I
commit to it .  If the number terrifies you, then you’re doing it right.
T rust the data. This is how you scale. And that’ s why most people
never do.
 
 
“How well am I doing?” - Cost & Returns - Efficiency
Benchmarks
 
Ef ficient paid ads make more money than they cost. If that sounds
painfully obvious, good. Y ou’ve already got most people beat. I
measure paid ad ef ficiency by comparing the lifetime gross profit
of a customer (L TGP) with the cost to acquire a customer (CAC). I
express this ratio as L TGP to CAC.
 
I Measure L TGP Instead of “Lifetime V alue” or “L TV”
 
Lifetime gr oss pr ofit  is all the money a customer ever spends on
your stuf f minus all the money it takes to deliver it. For example, if
a customer buys something for $15 and it costs $5 to deliver it,
your gross profit is $10. So if that customer buys ten things over
their lifetime, then they bought a total of $150 in stuf f. But it cost
you a total of $50 to deliver that stuf f.  That makes the lifetime
gross profit $100.
 
Gr oss pr ofit  is important in general because it's the actual money
you use to acquire customers, pay rent, cover payroll, and...
everything else to run your business.
 

 
So if you’ve ever heard me say “I’m getting 3 to 1 on this” I refer
to my L TGP-to-CAC ratio. I compare how much I made against
how much I spent. So if L TGP is greater than CAC, you have
profitable advertising. If it’ s lower than CAC, you’re losing money .
 
What's a good L TGP to CAC ratio? Every business I invest in that
struggles to scale has at least one thing in common - their L TGP to
CAC ratio was less than  3 to 1. As soon as I get it above 3 to 1
(either through decreasing CAC or increasing L TGP), they take
of f. This is a pattern I personally observed, not a rule.
 
 
Y ou have two big levers to improving L TGP:CAC:
 
Make CAC lower - Get cheaper customers. W e do this with
more ef ficient ads following the steps we just outlined.

 
Make L TGP higher - Increase how much you make per
customer . W e do this with a better business model.
 
For maximum money… I pr efer to do both .
 
For example, if you made a billion dollars per customer , then you
could spend nine hundred and ninety-nine million dollars to get a
customer and still  have a million dollars leftover . Y ou could spend
pretty much whatever it takes to get a customer . No matter how
crappy your ads - you’d still probably win. On the flip side, if you
made one cent per customer , you’d have to get each customer for
less than a penny  to make it work. Even with the best ads, you’d
fail.
 
I bring this up because we speak with hundreds of entrepreneurs
every month. They often think they have crappy ads (high CAC)
when, in reality , they have a crappy business model (Low L TGP).
Here’ s a finding that will probably surprise you as much as it
surprised me. The cost to acquire customers, between competitors
in the same industry , is much closer than you’d think . The
dif ference between the winners and the losers is how much they
make off each customer .
 
So how do you know if it’ s your ads or your business model that
needs work? I use the industry average CAC as my guide. 
Research your industry averages for the cost to acquire customers.
If your CAC is below 3x your industry average (good), focus on
your business model (L TGP). If your CAC is above 3x the average
(bad), focus on  your advertising (CAC).
 
Things can only get so cheap. Eventually you just gotta make
more. Think about it like this– lowering the cost of getting a
customer by $100 will eventually take more work than making an

extra $100 from them. So once your cost is low enough, focus on
your business model. Costs can only approach zero but how much
you make can go up to infinity . Increasing advertising ef ficiency
beyond a certain point is like trying to “save your way” to a billion
dollars. Y ou feel like you’re making progress, but you’re never
gonna get there.
 
 
“My ads ar en’t pr ofitable, how do I fix it?” → Client Financed
Acquisition
 
For many businesses, L TGP is bigger than CAC. Y ay . But not after
the first pur chase.  Boo. The profit from the customer ’ s first
pur chase  is often less than the cost to get them. It can take many
months to collect the full L TGP . So you get your money later
instead of now . This cash flow problem cripples your ability to
scale ads and get more customers. Boo again.
 
But… if your customer spends more than it costs you to get and
fulfill them–in the first 30 days–then you have the funds to scale
now  and for ever . I call this  client financed acquisition.
 
I pick thirty days because any business can get interest free money
for thirty days in the form of a credit card. And if we make more
than the cost to get and fulfill the customer in the first thirty days,
we square our balance. Now , we have zero debt and a new
customer which we can keep profiting from forever . Then, we
repeat the process. Money is no longer your bottleneck. This is the
key to limitless scale. I r epeat the same image above so you can
r efer ence it.
 

 
Let’ s see client financed acquisition in action:
 
Say we have a $15 per month membership that costs us $5 to
deliver . That leaves us $10 gross profit left over .
 
($15 membership) - ($5 cost) = $10 gross profit per month
 
And let’ s say our average member stays for ten months. That
makes our lifetime gross profit $100.
 
($10 gross profit per month) x (10 months) = $100 L TGP .
 
If the cost to get a customer is $30 (CAC = $30), we have a
3.3:1 L TGP : CAC ratio.
 
($100 L TGP) / ($30 CAC)  = 3.3 L TGP / 1 CAC →  3.3:1
Our ads make money . Hooray .
 

 
But wait…there’ s a problem. Y ou spent $30 in ads and only got
$10 back. T en bucks trickles in, one month at a time, until you
finally break even…two. months. later . That’ s tough! Make no
mistake, you should 100% make that trade. But, now we have a
cash flow  problem.
 
 
Here’ s the way I fix it- I immediately sell them mor e stuff
 

If I of fer a $100 upsell (with 100% mar gins) that one in five new
customers take. That adds $20 of gross profit per customer .
 
($100 upsell) /(5 customers) = $20 average upsell dollars per
customer .
 
This takes us from $10 to $30 in the first thirty days (our break-
even window). The first purchase is $10. But now  the average
upsell adds $20.
 
$10 + $20 = $30 gross profit per customer in less than 30
days.
 
And since it costs $30 to acquire them, we break even. Great!
 
$30 CAC - $30 cash collected within thirty days = free
customers!
 
Every $10 a month that comes in thereafter is “gravy .” Now , I can
go get another customer while I keep collecting that $10 profit per
month for the next nine months. This is how you print money . The
things you can sell or upsell are unlimited.
 
If I cover the cost to get and fulfill a customer in the first thirty
days I can pay of f my card, then do it again. It’ s how I’ve scaled
every company I’ve started for the past seven years past $1M/mo
in the first twelve months - without outside funding. W ith
ef ficiency out of the way , creativity is your only limit.
 
Bottom Line : Figure out a way to get your customers to pay you
back in the first thirty days so you can recycle your cash to get
more customers.

 
 
Personal Lessons fr om Paid Ads
 
1 . Don’t Confuse Sales Pr oblems W ith Advertising Pr oblems.
The cost to get customers doesn’ t only come from advertising (it
just mostly does)… For example, a company I invested in spent
twelve weeks and $150,000 to run paid ads. They were getting
the right leads on the phone, but they weren’ t buying. The owner
said advertising didn’ t work. But the ads worked fine, great
even, their sales sucked . The owner threw up his hands and gave
up…six inches from gold. Frustrating. Confusing an advertising
problem with a sales problem cost them an estimated ~$30M in
enterprise value. If your engaged leads have the problem you
solve and the money to spend, and they’re not buying, then your
ads work fine–you have a sales problem.
 
2 . Y our Best Fr ee Content Can Make The Best Paid Ads.  Some
of the best paid ads I’ve ever run came from free content. If you
make a free content piece that generates sales, or performs very
well, nine times out of ten it’ll make a great paid ad.
 
a . User Generated Content (UGC).  If you can get your
customers to create testimonials or reviews using your
product, post them. If they perform well as free content,
they often make killer ads too. Having a system in place
to encourage these public posts from customers is my
favorite way of getting a steady stream of potential ads.
And - the best part is - it’ s no extra work.
 
3 . If Y ou Say Y ou Suck At Something, Y ou W ill Pr obably Suck
At It.  Never say “I’m not techy” or “I hate tech stuf f.” It just
keeps you poorer than you should be. I said it for…wait for it…
FOUR YEARS. Then one day , I snapped because I hated my
website designer more than I hated tech itself. “If this idiot can

do it, so can I.” Four years of wasting time and lost money
reversed with four hours of concentrated ef fort.
 
 
Y our turn
 
I can teach you how to place an ad in twenty minutes. It’ll cost ya
$100. W orth it?  I hope so. It’ s an important skill. It won’ t make
you money , but you will learn a lesson worth far more than a
hundred bucks - running ads is easier than you think. In fact,
platforms spend zillions to make it as easy as possible (so they can
make more money).  Here’ s all you gotta do:
 
Search “HOW T O PLACE A [PLA TFORM] AD.” Then place one
for $100. Don’ t go all the way to the end then chicken out. Spend
the gosh darn money . Rip of f the bandaid. As soon as you do -
you’re no longer an observer , you're in the game.
 
Once you have put all these pieces together , it’ s time to send it.
Spend money . Start with an acceptable amount of money you are
willing to lose each month. Expect to lose it. Y ou won’ t be earning,
you’ll be learning.

Paid Ads Part II Conclusion
 
Paid ads are the fastest way to scale how many leads you get. W e
spent the lion’ s share of this chapter talking about ef ficiency .
Because once you understand how ads really make money , it
becomes much easier to win. I’ve been very successful with paid
ads, but it wasn’ t because I was the most creative or had the best
copy . It was because I knew the numbers. So follow the steps
outlined.
 
I recommend doing paid ads last  for two reasons. First, skills from
the other three methods transfer to this one. And second, paid ads
cost money . Money you will have if you start with the other three
methods first. So learn the skills and make the money from the
other three methods, so you have the shortest learning curve on this
one.
 
And once we have all that, we scale it. W e expect to lose more
times than we win. And once we win, we scale the hell out of it.
And that’ s how we do it.
Paid ads is the last of the core four ways a single person can let
other people know about their stuf f. But before we transition to the

second half of the book, I wanna show you how to put these
strategies on steroids.
