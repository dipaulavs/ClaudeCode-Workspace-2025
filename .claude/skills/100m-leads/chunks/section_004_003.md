How T o Build An Audience T o Get Engaged Leads
No one’ s ever complained about getting too much value.
 
 
January 2020
 
“Did you hear about Kylie Jenner?” Leila asked.
 
“No, why?” I replied.
 
“She’ s now the youngest female self-made billionaire.”
 
“W ait, what?”
 

“Y ea, she’ s twenty . Forbes just put her on the cover .”
 
I was ten years older than her and not  a billionaire. Why do I suck so
much?  How could she make so much more than me? I thought I was
pretty good at business–we took home $13M in personal income the
year before. But, I was clearly missing something. And I felt horrible
about it.
 
My ego protected me… W ell, Kris Jenner is her mother and she
must have or ganized all this.  I wrote it of f as “rich parents” and
moved on.
 
 
A few months later…
 
Leila looked up from her computer .
 
“Dude - Huda just sold a minority stake in her company at a $600M
valuation.”
 
“Huda, the makeup girl?” I replied.
 
“Y ea.”
 
“Holy cow .” Again?  How have I been scr ewing up so bad?  How was
someone so young making so much more money than me?
 
…She’ s in beauty , she can do that, I can’ t.  I told myself, then carried
on.
 
 

A few months later…
 
A headline caught my eye:
 
“Conor McGregor ’ s Proper 12 whiskey hits a $600M valuation
within 12 months of launching.”
Seriously!? - Another  person making gobs of money in what felt like
seconds.
 
 
A few months later…
 
I saw another headline. “W ith an Insane $3.5 Billion W orth, Dwayne
Johnson’ s ‘T er emana’ Sweeps the Floor W ith Conor McGr egor ’ s
‘Pr oper 12′.”
 
Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson was now a multi-billionaire. And he
never even talked about business! What am I doing wr ong?
 
 
A few months later… at a famous friend’ s house…
 
Up to this point, I stayed behind the scenes for the most part. I did
not want to be famous. I wanted to be rich. And I succeeded at that.

But seeing these successes chipped away at my beliefs. Could
building a personal brand be that  powerful? Simple answer - yes.
But, I wanted my privacy…
 
W e sat around his kitchen table, and I asked him, “Y ou get all these
weird messages from strangers. People threaten your family . Are you
still happy you became famous?” He replied with something that
changed my life forever:
 
“If getting weird messages and hate from  people I don't know is the
price I have to pay to make the impact I want to have, I’d pay that
price any day of the week.”
 
I felt exposed. I was being a pansy . I claimed I wanted to make the
impact, but wasn’ t willing to pay the price for it. After that
conversation, Leila and I went all in on building personal brands.
 
***
 
I have a core belief I’d like to transfer to you. If someone is making
more money than you, they are better at the game of business in
some way .  T ake it as good news. It means you can learn from them.
Don’ t think they had it easy . Don’ t think they had a shortcut. Don’ t
tell yourself they broke some moral code. Even if it’ s true, none of
those beliefs serve you. None of those beliefs  make you better .
 
Y ears ago, I was vocal about “making content.” I didn’ t see the
point. Why would I waste my time making something that would
disappear in a few days? I thought it was a stupid waste of time and
let everyone know . I was wrong. It really wasn’ t about the content at
all - it was about the audience. What I didn’ t understand was - the
content you create isn’ t the compounding asset - the audience is . So
even though the content may disappear in time, your audience keeps
growing.

 
This was a lesson my ego prevented me from learning for too long. It
took an entire year of getting hit in the face with solid evidence
before I changed my ways. Building an audience is the most
valuable thing I’ve ever done.
 
I saw Kylie Jenner , Huda Kattan, Connor McGregor , and The Rock
become billionaires “overnight.” My famous friend said a massive
audience was crucial to his success. The overwhelming evidence
broke my beliefs, so I rewrote them. I now saw the power of having
an audience. But, I didn’ t know where to start. So, I did what I
always do. I paid for knowledge.  Buying somebody else’ s experience
saves the time it would take to figure everything out yourself. Leila
bought me four calls with a big influencer who had the type of
audience I wanted to build. She paid $120,000.
 
On my first call, he told me to post regularly on every platform. So,
that's what I did. T welve months later , my audience grew by more
than 200,000 people. On my second call, he noted the progress. But I
wanted more, “Do you have a blueprint for your personal branding?
How do you put out all that content?”
 
He said, “Bro, anyone telling you there’ s some secret is trying to sell
you something. W e just put out as much as we possibly can. Pull up
your Instagram and pull up my Instagram... Look. Y ou’ve posted
once today . I posted three times. Pull up your LinkedIn… Look. Y ou
posted once this week. I posted five times today .” He went platform
by platform. I grew more embarrassed with each comparison.
 
“Y ou just gotta do more bro.”
 
Simple. Not easy . Over the next six months I put out ten times  the
content. And over the next six months, I added 1.2M people to my
audience. Also, when I put out ten times the content, my audience

grew ten times as fast. V olume works. Content works. A growing
audience is the result. And in this chapter , I’ll break down how I did
it so you can too.
 
 
How Building An Audience W orks - Y ou Post Gr eat Fr ee
Content
 
 
W arm reach outs don’ t get a lot of engaged leads for the time we
invest. If we want to reach ten people, we have to repeat ourselves
ten times. Lots of ef fort. By posting free content, we can say it once
and reach all ten. So, posting free content can get a lot more engaged
leads for the time we invest. Hooray .
 
The people who think it’ s valuable become part of your warm
audience. If they think other people will find it valuable, they share
it. And if the people they share it with like it, they become part of
your warm audience too. Rinse and repeat. The sharing can go on
infinitely .  The more they share your stuf f, the lar ger your warm
audience gets. And once in a while, you’ll make them an of fer . If
your of fer has enough value, they’ll take it. When they do, you make
money . And the bigger the audience, the more money you make .
Look at it this way:
 
Posting free content grows your warm audience.
 

So constantly posting free content means you’ll have a constantly
growing audience of people more likely to buy your stuf f.
 
Free content makes all other advertising more ef fective. If you
reach out to someone and they can’ t find content related to your
services, they’re less likely to buy . On the other hand, if they find
lots of valuable content, they are more likely to buy .
 
This is what my ego pr evented me fr om learning.  Now the headlines
with Jenner , Huda, McGregor , and The Rock all made perfect sense.
 
But, posting free content is not all sunshine and rainbows. It has
trade-of fs. First, it is more dif ficult to personalize your message. So
fewer people respond. Second, you compete with everyone else
posting free content. This makes it harder  to stand out. Third, if you
do stand out, people will copy you. This means you need to
constantly innovate.
 
That being said - A bigger audience means more engaged leads.
More engaged leads means more money . More money means you
more happy . Just kidding - it won’ t do that. But it’ll give you the
resources to remove stuf f you hate. Anyways…
 
This chapter covers only two topics. First, we demystify audience-
growing content by showing it’ s all made of the same basic units. A
content unit has three components - Hook, retain, and reward.
Second, how linking basic units together will make audience-
growing content for any platform or media type. The next chapter
(Post Free Content Part II) shows you how to weaponize this content
to make money . But for now , you can’ t monetize content until you
know how to make it.
 
 
The Content Unit - Thr ee Components

 
 
All audience-growing content does one thing - it rewards the people
consuming it. And a person can only get rewarded by the content if
they:
 
1)  Have a reason to consume it and
 
2)  Pay attention long enough to
 
3)  Get that reason satisfied.
 
Thankfully , we can reverse those three outcomes into the three
things we have to do to make audience-growing content .  This means
we have to:
 
a)   Hook  attention: get them to notice your content.
 
b)  Retain  attention: get them to consume it.
 
c)   Reward  attention: satisfy the reason they consumed it to begin
with.
 
The smallest amount of material it takes to hook, retain and reward
attention is a content unit . It can be as little as an image, a meme, or
a sentence. Meaning, you can hook, retain, and reward at the same
time . This is how short tweets, meme images, or even a jingle can go

viral. They do all three. I separate them so we can discuss them more
clearly , but they can all happen at once.
 
Let’ s dive into each of the things we do to create a content unit. This
way you can create ef fective content that grows your audience.
 
 
1) Hook: They cannot be rewarded unless we first get their attention.
 
 
The objective : W e give them a reason to redirect their attention from
whatever they are doing towards us. If we do that, we’ve hooked
them. The ef fectiveness of your hook is measured by the percentage
of people who start consuming your content. So if you hook
attention well, many  people will have a reason to consume your
content. If you do a poor job, few  people will have a reason to
consume your content. Remember , this is a competition for attention.
W e have to beat every alternative they have to win theirs. Make
yourself the best option.
 
W e increase the percentage of people who pick our content by
picking topics  they find interesting, headlines  that give them a
reason, and matching the format  of other stuf f they like. Let’ s dive
into each.
 
T opics. T opics are the things you make your content about. I prefer
to use personal experiences. Here’ s why: there’ s only one of you.

The easiest way to dif ferentiate is to say something no one else can
say . And no one else has lived your life but you. I divide topics into
five categories: Far Past, Recent Past, Present, T rending, and
Manufactured.
 
a)   Far Past : The important past  lessons in your life. Connect that
wisdom to your product or service to provide huge value to your
audience. Give them the story without the scar . It’ s why I write
these books .
 
i)             Example: A personal lesson where I broke my belief
that “I don't have enough time”:
 
1)  Hook: I complained to a friend that I didn’ t have
enough time to do something while glued to my
phone.
 
2)  Retain: They yanked it out of my hands and looked
at its usage. It showed I spent three hours per day
on social media.
 
3)  Reward: They looked back at me and said, “Hey , I
found you some time.”
 
It’ s a simple story other people can relate to. This
makes it an interesting topic to more people. And it
connects what I do, growing businesses, to a struggle
many people experience - not having enough time.
The epiphany I give away makes this lesson valuable
for my audience – people starting, growing, and selling
their businesses.
 
b)  Recent Past : Do stuf f, then talk about what you did (or what
happened). Any time you speak with somebody , there’ s a chance
your audience can get value from it. Look at your calendar for the
last week. Look at all your meetings. Look at all your social

interactions. Look at all your conversations with warm reach outs.
Ther e’ s gold in these conversations . T ell stories from them that
would serve your audience. For example:
 
 
i)             This tweet came from a meeting I had with a portfolio
CEO that was just copying the same of fer everyone else
in his market was making and was getting subpar results.
 
ii)             This means taking notes, recordings, and other records
to make that stuf f easy to access. But it also means a free,
easy , and valuable stash of content.
 
iii)             T estimonials and case studies fall in this category . If you
can tell a cool client story in a way that pr ovides value to
your audience , you’ll both promote your services and
provide value. W in-win.
 
c) Present : W rite down ideas at the exact time they come to you .
Always have a way to record your ideas in arms reach. I’ll even
pause meetings to make note of, text, or email ideas to myself.
People don’ t mind when you ask to take notes anyway , so it's not
weird. Then, when you make content, you have a bucket of fresh
stories to work with.
 
i)             I note my ideas publicly: I used to keep ideas to myself.
Now , I tweet them publicly as they happen. If a post does
better than normal, I know it's something people find
interesting. Then, I make more stuf f on that topic.
 

d) T rending : Go where the attention is. Look at what’ s trending right
now and make stuf f about it. Apply your own experiences to it. If
you have relevant commentary or it touches your expertise in
some way , talk about it. T alking about trendy stuf f is very
ef fective for gaining the attention of a broader audience.
 
e) Manufactured : T urn your ideas into reality .  Pick a topic people
find interesting. Then, learn about it, make it, or do it. Then, show
it to the world. This costs the most time and ef fort since you have
to create the experience versus talking about one you already had.
But, it can have the biggest payouts.
 
i)             Example manufactured experience: I lived on $100 for a
month. Her e’ s how .  Now I don’ t live that way , but I could
manufacture that experience then make content about it.
 

 
Action Step : Life happens–profit by sharing yours.
 
 
Headlines . A headline is a short phrase or sentence used to grab the
audience’ s attention. It communicates the reason they should
consume the content. They use it to weigh the likelihood they will
get a reward for consuming your content versus another .
 
Rather than give you a bunch of templates, I’d rather give you the
timeless principles that make great headlines. And, there’ s no greater
headline creator than “the news.” So let’ s study them.
 

A meta-analysis of news revealed headline components that drove
the most interest in stories. They are as follows. T ry and include at
least two in your headline.
 
a . Recency  - As recent as possible, quite literally the ‘new’ s
 
i . Example: People pay attention to something that
happened an hour ago more than a year ago.
 
b . Relevancy  - Personally meaningful
 
i . Example: Nurses pay more attention to stuf f that af fects
nurses compared to stuf f that af fects accountants.
 
c . Celebrity  - Including prominent people (celebrities, authorities,
etc.).
 
i . Example: Normally , we wouldn’ t care what another
human has for breakfast every day . But if it’ s Jef f
Bezos, we do. Since he’ s a celebrity , many people care.
 
d . Proximity  - Close to home – geographically
 
i . Example: A house on fire across the country doesn’ t get
your attention. If it’ s your neighbor , it sure does. Make
it as close to home as possible.
 
e . Conflict  - of opposing ideas, opposing people, nature, etc.
 
i . Example: Pineapple vs no Pineapple on pizza?
Conflict!
 
ii . Example: Good vs Evil. Hero vs V illain. Left vs Right.
 
iii . Example: Freedom vs Security . Justice vs Mercy . Y ou
get the idea.
 

f . Unusual  - odd, unique, rare, bizarre
 
i . Example: Think of a six-fingered man at the old-time
circuses. If it’ s outside of the norm, people pay more
attention.
 
g . Ongoing  - Stories still in progress are dynamic, evolving, and
have plot twists.
 
i . Example: If someone goes into labor , people want
updates every ten minutes because anything could
happen .
 
Action Step : Include one or more of these components to give
yourself meatier , attention-grabbing headlines.
 
 
Format . Once we have a good topic and communicate it with a
headline using one or more components, we need to match our
format to the best content on the platform. People consume content
because it’ s similar to stuf f they’ve liked in the past. And matching
the popular format of the platform gets the most people to interact
with it. So, we want to make our content look like the stuf f they’ve
liked before.
 
Format example:
 

 
This meme communicates the point better than I can with words. All
four images above are…well…images. But, they have a dif ferent
look and feel. This is because formatting depends on the audience
you want to hook and  the platform your audience is on.
 
Bottom Line:  Y ou’ve gotta make your content look like what they
expect will r ewar d them. Otherwise, no matter how good it is, better -
looking content will hook them before yours even has a chance.
 
Action Step : Format your content for the platform first. Then, tweak
it so it hooks your ideal audience. Use the best content on the
platform that tar gets your market as your guide.
 
This concludes the “hook” step of our content unit. Always  following
these basics will already put you in the top 1%. At least, it has for
me.
 
 

2) Retain
 
My favorite driver of retention is curiosity . It’ s my favorite because,
if done correctly , people will wait years. People want to know what
happens… next . For example, I get messages daily , for years now ,
about when I will release a book on sales.
 
My favorite way to get the audience curious is to embed questions in
their minds. Unresolved questions can be explicit or implicit. Y ou
can directly ask the question. Or , the question can be implied. My
three favorite ways to embed questions are: lists, steps, and stories.
 
 
a)   Lists : Lists are things, facts, tips, opinions, ideas, etc. presented
one after the other . Good lists in free content also follow a theme.
Think “T op 10 Mistakes” or “5 Biggest Money Makers” and so
on. Giving the number of listed items in your headline, or in the
first few seconds of your content, tells people what to expect. And
in my experience, this retains more of the audience's attention for
longer .
 

i)             Example: “7 W ays I invested $1000 in my 20s That
Paid Of f Big”
 
ii)             Example: “28 W ays T o Stay Poor”  
 
iii)             Example: “A content unit has three pieces…”,
 
b)  Steps : Steps are actions that occur in order and accomplish a goal
when completed. Provided the early steps were clear and valuable,
the person will want to know how to do them all to accomplish the
overall goal.
 
i)             Example: “3 Steps to Creating a Great Hook”
 
ii)             Example: “How I Create a Headline in 7 Steps”
 
iii)             Example: “The Morning Routine That Boosts My
Productivity”
 
Note: Here’ s the dif ference between steps and lists. Steps are actions
that must be done in a specific or der  to get a result. So steps are less
flexible but have a more explicit reward. Lists can have just about
anything on them in any order you want. So lists are more flexible
but have a less explicit reward.
 
c)   Stories : Stories describe events, real or imaginary . And stories
worth telling often have some lesson or takeaway for the listener .
Y ou can tell stories about things that have happened , might
happen , or will never happen.  All three drive curiosity because
people want to know what happens next.
 
i)             Ex: Almost every chapter in this book has a story .
 
ii)             Ex: “My editor made me do 19 drafts of this book -
here’ s what I did to him.”
 

iii)             Ex: “My journey from sleeping on the bottom floor of a
gym to the top floor of a 5-star hotel.”
 
Y ou can use lists, steps, and stories on their own or interweave them.
For example, you can have lists within steps, and a story about each
list item. Y ou can have stories to reinforce the value of a step. Y ou
can have a list of stories or many ongoing storylines. Etc. Y our
creativity is the only limit here. That’ s why people who make a lot of
content call themselves content cr eators . This chapter , for example,
has lists within steps and stories interweaving them.
 
Action Step : Use lists, steps, and stories to keep your audience
curious. Embed questions in their minds to make them want to know
what happens next .
 
 
3) Reward
 
Anyone can think of cool hooks and or ganize their content using
lists, steps, or stories. But the real question is - is it good? Does it
satisfy the reason they watched to begin with? Does it make people
want to share it? How good your content is depends on how often it
rewards your audience in the time it takes them to consume it . Think
value per second . For example, the same person who gets bored
three seconds into a ten-second video may also binge a 900-page
book. And that same person may binge a television series for eight
hours straight. So there is no such thing as too long, only too boring .
 

Now , we can’ t guarantee a specific reward. But, we can increase the
chance reward happens by:
 
Hooking the right  audience with proper topics, headlines, and
formatting
 
Retaining them with lists, steps, and stories to get them curious
and wanting more  
 
Clearly satisfying the reason the content hooked them to begin
with.
 
Example: If your hook promises “7 W ays to Make Up with Y our
Spouse” and you give:
 
(A) four ways (B) seven ways that stunk (or they’ve heard them all
before). (C) you’re talking to a room of single guys who don’ t have
spouses, you did a bad job of r ewar ding. People will not want to
watch again, and certainly won’ t share it.
 
Example: If your hook promises “4 Marketing Strategies Dentists
Can Use” and they can’ t use them, they will not share it or watch
your content in the future. Y ou did a bad job of r ewar ding.
 
Bottom line:  I’ve had tons of content I thought would smash records
but the audience smashed the next button instead. So no matter how
good you think your content is, the audience decides.  Rewarding
your audience means matching or exceeding their expectations when
they decide to consume your content .  Here’ s how you know if you
succeeded: your audience gr ows . If it’ s not growing, your stuf f isn’ t
that good. Practice and you’ll get better .
 
Action Step : Provide more value than anyone else. Make good on
your promises. Clearly satisfy the hook you used to get their

attention. In other words, completely answer the unresolved
questions you embedded in their minds.
 
 
So what’ s the differ ence between short and long form content?
Answer: not much.
 
If you recall from earlier , the smallest amount of material it takes to
hook, retain and reward attention is a content unit . So to create a
longer piece of content, we simply link content units together .
 
For example, a single step in a five-step list might be a content unit.
When we link all five together , we have a longer piece of content.
Here’ s a visual to drive it home.
 
 
Shorter content hooks, retains, rewards fewer times. Longer content
does it more times. And doing it more times takes more skill because
you have to string more “good” content units in a row . For example,
a new comedian typically will only get a few minutes on stage to
perform their “bit.” Only a master comic gets an hour . It takes
practice to reward attention just often enough to keep it for that long.
So, start small, then build from there. Even if you start with longer
content, which is fine, I suggest starting with shorter versions. Y ou’ll

have an easier go of it. Many successful authors with epic-length
novels started by writing…you guessed it…short stories.
 
 
Once you understand how to make a content unit, all you have to do
is mor e . Then, your audience will grow . And once your audience
grows big enough, you may want to monetize it. I had too much to
say to fit into one chapter , so we’ll talk about how to monetize the
audience in the next one.
 
 
See you there.
