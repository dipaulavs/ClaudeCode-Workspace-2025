“He who said money can’ t buy happiness hasn’ t given enough
away .” – Unknown
 
 
People who give without expectation live longer , happier lives  and
make more money . So if we’ve got a shot at that during our time
together , darn it, I’m gonna try .
 
T o do that, I have a question for you…
 
W ould you help someone you’ve never met if it cost you nothing,
but you didn’ t get cr edit?
 
Who is this person you ask? They are like you. Or , at least, like
you used to be. Less experienced, wanting to make a dif ference,
and needing help, but not sure where to look.
 
Acquisition.com’ s mission is to make business accessible to
everyone . Everything we do stems from that mission. And, the
only way for us to accomplish that mission is by reaching…well…
everyone .

 
This is where you come in. Most people do, in fact, judge a book
by its cover (and its reviews). So here’ s my ask on behalf of a
struggling entrepreneur you’ve never met:
 
Please help that entrepreneur by leaving this book a review .
 
Y our gift costs no money and less than 60 seconds to make real,
but can change a fellow entrepreneur ’ s life for ever . Y our review
could help…
 
….one more small businesses provide for their community .
 
….one more entrepreneur support their family .
 
….one more employee get meaningful work.
 
…one more client transform their life.
 
…one more dream come true.
 
T o get that ‘feel good’ feeling and help this person for r eal, all
you have to do is….and it takes less than 60 seconds…leave a
r eview .
 
 

If you are on audible  - hit the three dots in the top right of your
device, click rate & review , then leave a few sentences about the
book with a star rating.
 
If you are reading on kindle or an e-reader  - scroll to the bottom of
the book, then swipe up and it will prompt a review for you.
 
If for some reason these changed - you can go to Amazon (or

If you feel good about helping a faceless entrepreneur , you are my
kind of people. W elcome to #mozination. Y ou’re one of us.
 
I’m that much more excited to help you get more leads than you
can possibly imagine. Y ou’ll love the tactics I’m about to share in
the coming chapters. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Now , back to our regularly scheduled programming.
 
- Y our biggest fan, Alex

 
PS - Fun fact: If you provide something of value to another person,
it makes you more valuable to them. If you’d like goodwill straight
from another entrepreneur - and you believe this book will help
them - send this book their way .
