“Nothing makes friends like money”
 
 
December 1st, 2018
 
I had no idea how the Prestige Labs launch would go. I had no idea
if our clients would like it. I had no idea if the technology we built
would work. I had no idea if payouts would happen on time. I had
no idea if our warehouse would mess up orders.
 
But I did know over a year of preparation went into this launch.
W e put everything we had into creating a top-tier product. W e
spent over $1,000,000 custom-building af filiate software and
training. And - we bought $3,000,000 in inventory for sales that
may never happen. It took every business skill I had to make
Prestige Labs real. And, in just a few hours, we would roll it out to
our gym owner af filiates. I felt like a kid on Christmas Eve. And if
it didn’ t work, it wouldn’ t be for lack of effort.
 

 
 
Launch day…
 
I finished the two-hour presentation soaked in sweat. It’ s done .
 
I ‘sold’ the opportunity to sell my supplement line at their gyms. I
would train  the new af filiates to promote Prestige Labs at their
gyms. So, for this to work, they would have to go through the
training and  use it. But, if they did, everyone would profit. I had no
idea if it would work.
 
Thr ee weeks later…
 

W e made $150,000 in total  sales. Meanwhile, $3,000,000 worth of
product sat in an air -conditioned warehouse… It didn’ t work .
 
At this rate, including operating costs and af filiate payouts, it
would take five years to  br eak even . Even if we could stick it out,
our premium product would expire well before then. W e were all
but screwed. I felt miserable. It was terrible. Who am I to think we
would sell all that stuff? I just wasted MILLIONS. How could I be
so stupid?
 
But…on the fourth week…something wild happened…
 
BOOM! $100,000 on Monday .
 
BOOM! $1 10,000 on T uesday
 
BOOM! $92,000 on W ednesday .
 
W e did over $450,000 in sales the fourth week alone . The trend
continued. $429,000…$383,000…$41 1,000…$452,000. W e
averaged more than 300 orders per day across 400+ active
af filiates. Orders just kept coming in. Check out the snapshot of
our internal report below . It shows, from left to right, revenue by
week . I couldn’ t believe the results. Sometimes, I still can’ t.
 
 

The best part is, I didn’ t advertise or sell any of the pr oducts at all.
No paid ads. No sales team. Nothing. The af filiates did everything–
and the af filiate machine I built still prints money to this day . So if
that sounds like something you’re interested in, hang tight, because
I’m gonna show you exactly how I built it.
 
 
How Affiliates W ork
 
 
An affiliate  is a lead-getter . They are an independent business that
tells their audience to buy your  stuf f. Af filiates seem like referrals
on the outside, but are much dif ferent under the hood. First, they
have their own businesses and do their own advertising. Second,
they agree to of fer your  stuf f to their  engaged leads in exchange
for money , free stuf f, or both.
 
Now , you get af filiates by advertising and then making them of fers
just like you would customers. But, af filiates demand a unique type
of of fer . Instead of of fering your product, you of fer a fast, simple,
and easy way to make commissions promoting it. And that can
mean literally millions of engaged leads to your business. So this
makes af filiates one of the highest-leverage lead-getters out there.
 
 

Why Y ou W ant An Affiliate Army
 
Each af filiate you get adds another str eam  of leads and customers.
So recruiting, activating, then integrating with an army of af filiates
causes crazy scaling, fast. That's good. W e want that.
 
Compare these two scenarios:
 
 
Scenario #1:  Y ou sell ten customers  per month worth $10,000
each. Y our business caps at $100,000 per month. In twelve months
you’ve made 1.2 million. Assuming no other advertising, your
business plateaus . Low-Leverage.
 
 
Scenario #2:  For the same ef fort, you sell ten affiliates  per month.
Each month, those af filiates bring you one  of those $10,000
customers. Now , every single month you add an extra  $100,000 in

revenue. In twelve months you’ve made 7.8 million . And it grows
every month ther eafter . Same work, more money .  High-Leverage.
 
Let’ s use ALAN, my software company I grew with af filiates, to
show how this works in the real world:
 
ALAN grew with three levels of af filiates:
 
1)  Agency super -af filiates who brought agency leads
 
2)  Agencies who brought local business leads
 
3)  Local businesses who brought end consumer leads 
 
One super -af filiate added ten agencies per month. The ten agencies
brought in a combined fifty or so local businesses per month.
Those local businesses brought in a combined 2500 leads per
month. ALAN worked those leads for about $5 a pop. A cool
$12,500 per month .
 
But it didn’ t stop there. Each super -af filiate brought in mor e
agencies who brought in mor e  local businesses who brought mor e
leads every month after that. So every super -af filiate we signed on
brought in $12,500 the first month, $25,000 the second, $37,500
the third, and so on. W ith only a few agency super -af filiates, we
scaled to $1,700,000 per month within six months of launching.
That’ s  why you want an af filiate army . So let’ s build one.
 
How T o Build An Affiliate Army in Six Steps
 
Af filiates are among the most advanced ways to get engaged leads.
First, you have to convince them to advertise someone else's stuf f.

Second, you have to convince them to advertise your  stuf f. Third,
you have to keep them advertising  to make them a long-term lead
source. It seems like a lot. And it is. But, I have good news…
 
I’ve built two companies with af filiates: ALAN and Prestige Labs.
T ogether , they have done more than $75,000,000 in revenue from
over 5000+ af filiates. And the af filiate strategies I share worked for
me. So they can work for you. I’ll break down each step.
 
Step 1 : Find Y our Ideal Af filiates
 
Step 2 : Make Them an Of fer 
 
Step 3 : Qualify Them
 
Step 4 : Figure Out What T o Pay Them
 
Step 5 : Get Them Advertising
 
Step 6 : Keep Them Advertising
 
That’ s it. Let’ s dive in.
 
 
Step 1: Find Y our Ideal Affiliate
 
The ideal af filiate has a business with a warm audience full of
people like your customers. Start making a list of those businesses.
If none come to mind, answer these questions about your best
customers:

 
What do they buy? → Who pr ovides that stuff?
 
Wher e do they go? → What businesses ar e in those surr ounding
ar eas?
 
What do they like to do? → Who pr ovides those services?
 
If direct to consumer – the employers of your consumers could
make great af filiates:
 
What types of businesses do they work for? What kinds of jobs do
they have?
 
In a nutshell…  Who’ s got my leads!?
 
For example, when I started ALAN, agency owners were my ideal
af filiate. So I made a list of 200 products and services for agencies
and the businesses that delivered them. After a little bit of work I
realized they fit pretty neatly into categories: softwar es, pr oducts,
equipment, services, gr oups they belong to, and events they
attended . Every time I create a new af filiate “hit list” I start with
these categories. Note: If you find a business that falls into
multiple categories, there’ s a high chance they’ve got lots of good
leads for you and that they’d make a great af filiate.
 
Now that I knew the businesses that had my leads I knew exactly
where to put my advertising ef forts. It wasn’ t fancy , so don’ t
overthink it.
 

Action Step : Make a sheet with each of these questions and
categories. Search online to fill it in. If you struggle, call up your
customers and ask them! End result : Create a lead list of your
highest potential af filiates.
 
 
Step 2: Make Them An Offer
 
W e make the af filiate-of fer and advertise it the same way we
would any other of fer . W e call out our audience, show our value
elements, and then call them to action. But af filiates will only sign
up with us if we give them a strong reason. Thankfully , it’ s pretty
simple. Since af filiates are businesses, or start a business by
signing up, you offer them a new way to make money . W e’ll start
with the callout.
 
Call out:
 
Call outs for potential af filiates often include:
 
The af filiate business owners themselves - A TTENTION  SP A
OWNERS
 
The af filiate’ s customers - Do you work with busy pr ofessionals
who spend all day in meetings?  
 
Results the af filiate businesses promise - T o the her oes who heal
the str ess of others…
 
Products and services the af filiates deliver - If you sell lotions or
scented oils this is for you…
 

T o our own customers - Do you know anyone who owns a spa?
 
Now that we can grab a potential af filiate’ s attention - let’ s make it
worth their while…
 
 
Elements Of V alue
 
There’ s an unlimited number of ways to show value, but all money
making of fers follow a similar structure. That’ s good news, we
don't need to reinvent the wheel. Most af filiate money making
of fers show value like this:
 
Make mor e money fr om your curr ent customers and get mor e leads
than your curr ent offer ( dr eam outcome )…with a high chance of
working since your customers alr eady want the pr oduct ( per ceived
likelihood of achievement )...without needing to build, deliver , or
pr ovide customer support for the pr oduct yourself ( effort and
sacrifice )...so you can start selling it tomorr ow ( time delay ).
 
Action Step:  Explore the dif ferent value elements and fill in the
blanks. I won't go deeper on this since we’ve covered it already .
Y ou simply need to make affiliates  the customer you’re advertising
to.
 
Now that we’ve got the potential af filiate interested in our of fer ,
let’ s qualify them.
 
 
Step 3: Qualify Them
 

Potential af filiates become actual af filiates when they understand
and agree to your terms. And - just like customers - we want to get
them their first win as fast as possible. So we setup our terms to
force them to win as fast as possible.
 
I do that by getting them to invest. I prefer they invest their time,
their money , and  in the product itself. Any can work. But, nine
times out of ten, if they pay , they’ll pay attention . Here are the two
ways I get my af filiates invested and winning: make them a
customer , and make them an expert. Let’ s dive into each.
 
 
W ay #1: Make Them A Customer :  Make them buy and
preferably use the product to keep af filiate status. This is the
lowest barrier investment that’ s worked for me. I’ve found the
more money an af filiate invests in your product, the more money
they make. This should make sense. If they don’ t believe in your
stuf f enough to buy it, they probably shouldn’ t sell it. Y ou can tell
them I said so.
 

 
 
W ay #2: Make Them An Expert :  I make them pay for the
onboarding and training that certifies them as a product expert. If
you have them buy a product to become an af filiate, you can have
them use that as credit towards a certification. As in, the
certification comes with  the products they bought. Now , aside from
actually making the af filiate useful, certifying them does two
things. First, it covers some of the costs of advertising. Second, it

means I can af ford proper onboarding and training of every . single.
af filiate.
 
How much do I charge? I recommend 10-20% of what the
average active af filiate makes in the first twelve months. So if your
average af filiate makes $40,000 per year selling your stuf f, then
char ge $4000-$8000 to onboard and train them. T oo low , and you
won’ t get them invested. T oo high and you won’ t get enough
af filiates. I found 10-20% maximizes the number of people who
become active  af filiates. If you’re just getting started and have
physical products then use the bulk purchasing strategy from the
pro tip. Otherwise, you can use the strategy from the warm
reachout chapter and raise the minimum investment every 5 sign
ups until you hit the sweet spot.
 
Action Step : Make your af filiates customers, experts, or both (my
favorite way).  If you don't get enough people to start, lower the
commitment. If you don't get enough people to follow through,
raise it. 
 
 
Step 4: Figur e Out What T o Pay Them
 
 
The first biggest problem to solve with af filiates is getting them
bought in. But the second biggest problem is how to keep them
bought in.  And no matter how you slice it, keeping your af filiates

bought in depends on how you reward them for advertising your
stuf f. I prefer to reward people that do things I like with money and
free stuf f, especially if they make me money first. So let’ s talk
about that.
 
When I figure out ways to pay af filiates I look at two basic things:
 
1 . What they get paid for 
 
2 . How much they get paid
 
 
1. What  They Get Paid For 
 
Before I do any af filiate payout money math I ask myself a simple
question. What exactly  do I want the af filiate to do? Once I figure
that out, that  is what I pay them for . Then, more often than not,
how much they get paid and how often they get paid nearly solve
themselves. I pay af filiates for two basic things: new customers,
and repeat customers. Over time, if you track your metrics better ,
you can pay them for steps befor e  someone becomes a customer .
Like for the lead magnets downloaded, appointments set, or
anything else you know reliably turns into sales for you.
 
2. How Much  They Get Paid
 
I suggest paying af filiates based on your maximum allowable cost
to acquire a customer (CAC).
 
Example: choosing your maximum allowable CAC . Let’ s say we
sell a single-use product for $200 and it costs $40 to fulfill. This
gives us $160 to pay the af filiate and  run the business. If we want
an L TGP:CAC ratio of 3:1 then three parts goes to the business–

$120. And one part , $40,  goes to the af filiate. This means we will
pay up to $40 for an af filiate to get a new customer .
 
But here’ s where things get interesting. I used to give away the
farm (the whole CAC). I suppose I still do, but I’ve gotten pickier
about who I give it to. Not all af filiates are created equal. So, I
suggest having a three-tier  payout structure. Using the example
above, with a $40 maximum allowable CAC, a three-tier payout
structure might look something like this:
 
●    T ier 1: 25% CAC = $10 Payout - Anyone who agrees  to my initial
terms qualifies.
 
○    Example: They sign up and buy products or a certification.
 
●    T ier 2: 50% CAC = $20 Payout  - Once they activate .
 
○    Example: actually finishing the certification  they bought ,
doing a specific number of posts and outreach, doing a
launch, etc.
 
○    This gives them a nice reward (twice the pay) for activating.
 
●    T ier 3: 100% CAC = $40 Payout - Once they sustain  a level of
performance.
 
○    Example: They maintain five customers per month on
subscription.
 
This tiered method also has a hidden and very profitable side
ef fect. The average  payout is much less than your maximum
allowable CAC. This means if we leave the maximum payouts for
top af filiates, then we get to keep the “leftover” profit. W e can use
the leftover money to run huge contests, advertise to get more

af filiates, incentivize rising stars, etc. Or , I suppose, we can just
plain pocket it.
 
For example, if 20% of sales come from tier 1, 20% from tier 2,
and 60% from tier 3, your blended payout is $30 instead of your
maximum allowable CAC of $40. This means your L TGP : CAC
ratio just improved from 3:1 to 4:1. And often, cutting marketing
costs by 33% can translate into 10% to 20% more net profit at the
end of the year . A massive jump.
 

 
Action step: Figure out what you want to pay your af filiates for so
that you can plan out how much to pay them, with what, and how
often.
 

 
Step 5: Get Them Advertising – Launch
 
Like referrers, how much value af filiates get from you determines
how much they advertise your stuf f. So, tr eat them like customers.
Give them something good, fast. And nothing does that for
af filiates like big launches and lots of cash.
 
Here’ s how launches work:
 
Af filiates advertise your lead magnet or core of fer to their audience
befor e they can buy it . They post. They do warm outreach. They
run paid ads. They may even do cold outreach. They do as much
advertising as they can until the day of launch. When the product is
available, they sell it to all the engaged leads they assembled.
Some sell one-on-one, some pitch to the whole group. And others
simply make the product available.
 
So if you’re gonna do launches to activate your af filiates, which
you should, you may as well do them right. I use the whisper -
tease-shout method. I can’ t remember where I first heard this, but
the name stuck. Let’ s launch.
 
 
Before we get launching, remember: good launches have the work
done ahead of time.  So do all the work for them. Then, they can

plug and play . Let’ s break down each launch phase. And, I’ll give
an example of my book launch to drive each point home. Note: this
is how you launch anything, not just af filiates. I put it in the
af filiates section because I haven’ t found a better way to activate
af filiates than launches.
 
Whisper : Think “Call Outs.”  Like an ad, the key to the whisper
phase is curiosity . Keep the product itself mysterious and hint at
how big of a deal it is. Keep whispers short. And bonus points if
you show behind the scenes of making your product.
 
If you have something in the works, you can start the whisper
phase a few years out. The further out you start whispering, the
bigger deal it becomes to your audience. W e start this early
because, the longer something appears to take, the more an
audience will value it. For example, all other things being equal, an
audience will value a product that took ten years to make more
than one that took ten days. So - show your work .
 
Remember: curiosity comes from wanting to know what happens
next . So embed questions about the product in their minds. W e
need to tell them about something they want to know more about,
then say… not yet .
 
For example during the whisper phase of my book launch : I posted
content, reached out to friends, emailed my list, and told potential
af filiates about major updates to the book. I showed what draft I
was on. I took pictures behind the scenes of me printing out drafts.
I showed the many versions of the frameworks I drew . I shared
videos of myself editing the book early in the morning and late at
night, etc…all of it made people who want leads  get curious and
pay attention .
 

Action Step : Start whispering every four to six weeks until you get
sixty days out. Then whisper every two to three weeks until you
get thirty days out. Then, start teasing…
 
 
T ease :  Think “Elements Of V alue.”  It’ s time to start satisfying all
the curiosity you created during the whisper phase. Reveal your
product, make the date of the launch public, and start showing  the
elements of value. Use the What-Who-When Framework from the
paid ads chapter .
 
For example during my book launch, the tease phase : I was more
specific and revealed more “hard” information about the book. I
started advertising how the book satisfied the dream outcome of
limitless leads. Of doing less work, and getting it done faster than
they could imagine. I also showed dozens of examples using the
book to its potential.
 
Action Step : Start teasing once per week until fourteen days out.
Then tease twice per week until three days out. Three days out, it’ s
time to shout from the rooftops.
 

 
Shout:  Think “Call to Action.”  Give specific actions for the
audience to take when the product launches. Now you start
pounding the audience with bonuses, scarcity , ur gency , and
guarantees around being “the first ones.” Y ou shout to get as many
people exposed to your of fer as you can.
 
For example during my book launch, the shout phase : I gave
specific calls to action. Short, sweet, clear reminders to register for
the book launch. I reminded everyone of the exclusive bonuses
only for people who bought during the launch.
 
Action Step : Shout at least twice a day starting three days out. On
the day of, start shouting every few hours until two hours out. Then
shout every thirty minutes until you launch the product.
 
 

Action Step : Get your af filiates to launch. Set them up with
everything they need to do the whisper -tease-shout right. They do
the advertising. Y ou get the engaged leads. Everyone  gets paid.
 
 
Step 6: Keep Them Advertising
 
The strategy we use to start  them advertising dif fers from the one
we use to keep  them advertising. In an ideal world, you sell an
af filiate once and they send engaged leads for life. Integration gets
us there.
 
I’ve got three ways you can integrate your product into their of fer .
I order these from easiest to hardest. First, you can get them to give
away your lead magnet  with every purchase of their stuf f. Second,
you can get them to sell your lead magnet separately  to their
audience. Third, you can get them to directly sell your cor e offer .
 
 
They give away your lead magnet for fr ee, which makes their cor e
offer mor e valuable for no extra cost. Then, you upsell your cor e
offer and every offer ther eafter .
 
 

1) Affiliates Give Y our Lead Magnet A way When Somebody
Buys Their Stuff. The idea here is for your lead magnet to make
the af filiate’ s of fer more valuable. This allows them to char ge more
for it and  get more leads than they could without it. Remember , the
best lead magnets give away a free trial or sample of your thing,
reveal a problem, or of fer a single step of a multi-step solution.
Here are examples of each:
 
Samples And T rials : Say I sell massages and recruit the personal
training studio next door as an af filiate. Now , everyone who buys
personal training from them gets a free massage from me. The
personal training studio now has a stronger of fer they can char ge
more for and we get more massage leads. Everybody wins.
 
Reveal a Problem : Instead of giving a free massage, we of fer a free
or discounted posture assessment with every training package they
sell. Assessments and discounts add less value to the af filiate’ s
of fer , but some people will still do it. And to be clear , after
assessing the customer , you make them an of fer to solve the
problems you revealed.
 
One Step In A Multi-Step Process : Say you have a three-part
treatment plan. Massage, stretching, and adjustments. People
getting enough value from one step will fear missing out on the
rest of the steps. So the more they think the other steps will help
solve their lar ger problem, the more likely they are to buy them.
Y our af filiate would give away step one of your multi-step process
for free. Y ou’d upsell the leads from there.
 
What I did.  W e’d get gym af filiates to give away a free nutrition
consult to every new member . Then, we’d upsell our products at
the consult. They can market that they have nutrition consults
included to get more leads and they could char ge more for the
added value. And we get the opportunity to sell those leads.
Everybody wins.

 
 
 
They sell their cor e offer . Then, they upsell your lead magnet.
Then, you upsell your cor e offer and every offer ther eafter .
 
2) Affiliates Sell Y our Lead Magnet . Basically , the af filiate can
sell anything of yours that turns their customers into your
customers. It could be a book, an event, a service, software, a
sample product, etc. Also, giving af filiates all the cash from selling

a lead magnet you fulfill  becomes all profit and no work for them–
an attractive proposition for any business. Y our money comes by
selling your main thing for more than it cost you to deliver your
lead magnet. And if you do it this way , you don't need to split any
money with them on your core of fer . Another win-win.
 
Example: They sell each of those things we gave away for free in
the step above . They sell your massage at a discounted price. They
sell your assessment (which you could do 1-1 or in a group format
like a workshop). They sell part one of your multi-step solution.
 
What I did.  The gyms would sell a nutrition consult with us and
keep the money . They’d maybe char ge $99 or $199 to sell an hour
of our time. If we were clever , we’d let them keep all the money . If
we do, they’ll send us even more leads. Then, we’d upsell our
products during the consult.
 
 
…then you split the money . Either you split the upfr ont cash, all
cash for a certain period of time, or all cash for ever . I pr efer to pay
for ever so my affiliates stay motivated to keep my customers
for ever . And, I never cap payouts.
 
3) Affiliates Sell Y our Cor e Offer . An af filiate sells your core
of fer directly to their customers and adds another source of income
without extra work. For some af filiates, this is their entire source of

income! Many companies of fer this structure as either a new
business opportunity or a bolt-on to the af filiate’ s existing
business. Either way , anything you sell, they can sell. When you do
it this way , the af filiate will get a higher percentage of your
lifetime gross profit - but - you won’ t have to do anything but
deliver .
 
Example : They sell your entire massage package. They sell your
entire program or services. They bundle their services with your
paid services and char ge an even higher price.
 
What I did.  W e taught gyms to hold nutrition consultations with
white labeled products. Then we taught them to upsell our
supplements right to their members and we split the money .
 
 
All three strategies work. They’re just dif ferent. After testing, we
continue to do Strategy 1 (twice per year as a big event) and
Strategy 3 on an ongoing basis. That being said, many similar
businesses in our portfolio use Strategy 2. I'm just sharing what
worked for us.
 
Bottom Line : Integration is the long term strategy for using
af filiates to get enduring lead flow . T reat af filiates like customers.
Make your of fer make sense for their business. Make it so good
they’d feel stupid saying no.
 
Action Step:  Integrate with your af filiates by choosing whether
you want them to give your lead magnet away , to sell your lead
magnet, or to sell your core of fer directly .
 
Those are the six steps to recruiting an af filiate army . Now that we
covered that, let me give you three real-life case studies to drive

this home.
 
 
Thr ee Case Studies Y ou Can Model
 
Service Business Case Study #1: National T ax Preparation
Services
 
My friend's $50M business prepares LLCs, bank accounts, and
articles of incorporation. He focuses on people starting businesses
for the first time. But, he doesn't try to compete with Legalzoom.
Instead, he built it partnering with people who train new
entrepreneurs. His strategy is simple: help those people sell more
of their stuf f by also selling his stuf f. So, he of fers every af filiate’ s
customer a free LLC setup. Remember learning about the “high
cost lead magnet” from Section II? This is one of those.
 
Launch : He does a big blast of f seminar to his af filiates’ audiences
to kick things of f. People happily take him up on his free LLC
of fer . That's his lead magnet.
 
Integrate : Once af filiates see the success of the launch, they
integrate his lead magnet into their core of fer . Then, my friend’ s
team gets on the phone with the customers his affiliates bring him
for fr ee . Here's how he makes his money . He sells them what
they'll need next. The services they'll need to start their business:
bookkeeping, tax preparation, etc.
 
He hasn’ t spent a dollar on paid ads. His true advertising costs are
two things. One, delivering his free lead magnet (the LLC setup).
And two, paying a percentage of every first sale to the af filiates
that sent them. That's it. And everybody wins.

 
Physical Products Case Study #2: Prestige Labs, my supplement
company
 
W e sell gym owners at Gym Launch and train them how to
advertise and sell their gym memberships. Prestige Labs has a line
of supplements for active adults. This makes Gym Launch a
perfect af filiate for Prestige Labs. It has a community of gym
owners that also have active adult customers.  So when Gym
Launch sells a new gym owner , they introduce the new gym
owners to Prestige Labs. Then the Prestige Labs team follows the
“launch then integrate” strategy above. (W e really do this).
 
Launch : W e give the gym owners advertising materials so they
can re-engage their current and former customers. W e focus on
warm outreach and posting free content for a free 28 day
challenge. When they come in for the free challenge, gym owners
sell them supplements to use with the program. The gym owner
gets more customers. They make money . W e make money .
Everyone wins.
 
Integrate : After the launch, we teach them to sell supplements to
every new  gym member . So when new clients buy a membership
package, the gym owner sets up a nutrition orientation. At the
nutrition orientation, the gym owner sells them $50-$1000 of
supplements. So if a gym signs up twenty clients per month, and
gets seventy percent of them to buy supplements, we get fourteen
new customers per month per gym. It doesn’ t sound like much, but
when you multiply 4000 gyms x 14 new sales per month x $200
average order = a lot of money every month.
 
Local Business Case Study #3: Chiropractors
 

Chiropractors want new patients. And a portfolio company of ours
teaches them to use an af filiate strategy to get them. Their model is
simple: go to high volume businesses that have people that are in
need of adjustments. A gym fits the bill nicely . Here’ s what they
do.
 
Launch : They get the gym owner to promote a three hour
workshop where they show correct exercises and posture to get
more from their workouts. The gym owner promotes the workshop
for free or  sells the workshop for $29-$99 per person. The
chiropractor splits the money with the gym owner . Hint: if you
give the af filiate (gym owner in this case) 100% of the money ,
they’ll want to do it more. So if a gym gets thirty people to show
up for $99, they make $2970 profit for zero work besides a few
emails and posts. At the workshop the chiropractor soft pitches
their services and gets a bucket of new patients. Easy peasy lemon
squeezy .
 
Integrate : Long term, the chiropractor convinces the gym owner
to include one to two adjustments with every new membership the
gym signs up. This increases the value of the gym membership
compared to the guy down the street. And, it shows the gym
prioritizes its members health and safety (a big concern for
beginners). W in win. Now , every new gym member becomes a
lead for the chiropractor to follow up with. They repeat this
process with thirty gyms, and get more patients than they can
handle.
 

 
 
Costs and Returns
 
 
“Affiliates can’ t work for my business” the loser said.
“I have to make affiliates work for my business” the winner said.
Be a winner .
 
When calculating returns with other methods, we compared
lifetime gross profit (L TGP) with cost to acquire a customer
(CAC). So we spend money to get customers and the customers, in
a profitable business, give us mor e  money back. Af filiates work

dif ferently . W e spend money to get af filiates, sure. But we don’ t
really make much back fr om  af filiates themselves. Instead, the
money we spend to get an af filiate comes back fr om the customers
they bring us. So to calculate returns, we compare how much it
costs us to get an af filiate with the gross profit of all  the customers
they send to our business.
 
Example:
 
Let’ s say we own a widget company that grows with af filiates.
 
●    It costs us $4000 in advertising to get an af filiate. CAC = $4000
 
●    Our average af filiate sells $10,000 in widgets per month and stays
for 12 months.
 
○    ($10,000 per month ) x (12 months) = $120,000 total sales
 
●    The widgets have 75% gross mar gins. In other words, they cost
25% of retail price to make.
 
○    ($120,000 total sales) x (25% cost of goods) = $30,000 total
cost of goods
 
○    ($120,000 total sales ) - ($30,000 total cost of goods) =
$90,000 in gross profit from all the customers the af filiate
brings 
 
●    W e pay af filiates 40% of the gross profit:
 
○    ($90,000 gross profit) x (40% payout) = $36,000 to the
af filiate as payment.
 
●    Here’ s the gross profit we have left after cost of goods and payouts:
 

○    ($120,000 total) - ($30,000 costs) - ($36,000 payouts) =
$54,000 leftover 
 
●    Let’ s find our af filiate L TGP to CAC ratio: 
 
○    ($54,000 gross profit left) / ($4000 to get an af filiate) = 12.5 :
1 
 
…Not too shabby .
 
 
If you recall from earlier , we need to be at least  at 3:1 to have a
decent business. Like the example, we want the ratio even higher
than that (5:1, 10:1+). Now , if we had these numbers, we’d just do
mor e . But, if your actual L TGP : CAC is less than 3, here are the
three ways to improve it:
 
1) Lower CAC: W e get af filiates for less  (by improving our ads, of fer ,
and sales process).
 
2) Increase L TGP & Decrease CAC: Get more to activate  (by creating
a launch process).
 
3) Increase L TGP: W e make them worth mor e  (by improving our
integration process).
 
W ith af filiates, you now have at least two layers of customers.
Y our customers, and the people who get you customers. And if
you’ve got super -af filiates you add a third, the people who get you
the people who get you customers! This adds complexity , but if
you can manage it, it’ s worth it.
 

Now that you understand how to use af filiates to advertise, and
how to make them more profitable– let’ s bring it all home.
 
 
Conclusion
 
Like referrals, af filiates aren’ t an advertising method you can ‘do.’
They’re people who advertise your stuf f to benefit you both. Y ou
do the core four to get them, and if you want them to love you,
then you tr eat them like customers . Because in a lot of ways, they
ar e . And if you deliver more value to them than it costs them to get
it (especially hidden costs), they’ll get you more leads than you can
handle.
 
And like we learned earlier , there are two ways to create a
compounding business. Y ou can find more people that never stop
buying your stuf f or  you can find more people who never stop
selling it for you.  Referrals are the former . Af filiates are the ladder .
 
In theory , once you build an af filiate army , you never need to
advertise again. They keep getting you leads month after month.
The main reason - it makes sense for them. The way you do
business, your leadership, and the value of your product all come
into play . Y ou are only as good as the goodwill you have with your
af filiate partners. Arrange it right and you should both be better of f
from the relationship. They should be able to spend more to
acquire customers through a more compelling of fer , higher profits,
or both. And, in return, you get more engaged leads. So why
doesn’ t everyone do this? They don’ t know it’ s possible. They
don’ t know how . Or , they don’ t want to. Simple as that. Hopefully
we solved all three of those issues at once.
 

Remember , advertising always works , it’ s only a matter of
ef ficiency . So once you start, keep going until it works.
 
 
Action Steps
 
Advertise your af filiate of fer until you get ten to twenty af filiates.
Get results with those af filiates and use their feedback to work the
kinks out of your of fer , terms, launches, and integration strategy .
Then, scale like crazy by turning their results into your first batch
of af filiate lead magnets.
