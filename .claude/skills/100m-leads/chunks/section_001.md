T o T r evor:
Thank you for your true friendship. Thank you for your tireless
ef fort to extract the ideas out of my head. And, for your continued
support in slaying the nihilism monster . People say you are lucky if
you have one real friend in your entire life. Thank you for being
the best friend a man could ask for .

Even though Lady Gaga said it first, it doesn’ t make it any less
true.
“Y ou found the light in me that I couldn’ t find.
The part of me that’ s you will never die.”
