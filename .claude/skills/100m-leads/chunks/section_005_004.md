“Everything is for sale”
 
 
Summer 2016.
 
I wasn’ t a tech guy . I was a fitness guy who had learned a few
marketing and sales tricks building my gyms. But now I had five,
and was launching my sixth. It was time to level up. Facebook had
just released some new features: retar geting, interest groups,
pixels, etc. And I didn’ t understand any of it. I bought a few
courses but ended up more confused than when I started.
 
I asked a few friends if they knew anyone who could help. I got
two referrals. Both were agencies. I was scared. I had never used
one before. I had only ever heard horror stories about advertising
agencies. Mostly that they cost a ton and never work. But then I
realized that even if they did work, I’d need  them forever . They’d
have my business by the balls! It turns out my expectations weren’ t
far of f. They of fered to run my ads alright, for an arm and a leg.
Money I couldn’ t justify spending with my low mar gins. But, then

again, my advertising costs were killing me. And at this rate, in a
few months, I wouldn’ t be able to keep my doors open. Stressful.
 
I refused the first agency because I couldn’ t af ford it at the time.
The second call started going the same way . I began to panic. How
am I gonna fix this?  In what felt like a last ditch ef fort to stay in
business, I asked the second agency owner for what I r eally
wanted…
 
“Can you just show me in a few hours how you would run ads on
my account?”
 
“No.” He fired back. “My time’ s not for sale.”
 
W orried but still hopeful… “What sort of arrangement could we
come to?”
 
He thought for a moment. Then his eyebrow shot up and a smirk
appeared. “Fine. $750 an hour .” Gulp . His intimidation tactic
worked. But at least I knew his time was for sale... so I wanted to
find out more.
 
“And for $750 per hour you will sit down with me  and show me
how you  would run my ads?”
 
“Y es.”
 
“And, I’d be the one doing everything? Like, you’ll walk me
through what to do and look over my shoulder as I do it, then
you’ll explain why you do it that way?”
 

“Y ea”
 
“And you’re confident you can make my ads more profitable? …
and show me the more advanced stuf f too, right?”
 
“Y ea. I mean. If you wanna pay me $750 an hour , we can do
whatever you want. It’ s your money” He said, half laughing. It
sounded more like It’ s your funeral.
 
I paused. “Alright. I’ll do it. W e’ll meet one hour a week. Y ou give
me homework and I’ll study between calls. Fair enough?”
 
“W orks for me. But you gotta pay for the first four hours up front”
 
So that’ s what I did. I placed a three thousand dollar bet on this
guy’ s word that he knew what he was doing. Y ikes . But, every
week thereafter , I showed up. And like a good student, I came with
notes and questions ready . I also recorded and rewatched every call
because I didn’ t want to miss anything.
 
The first two calls, he took the wheel and I watched. Calls three
and four , he put me in the driver ’ s seat. By calls five and six, it
clicked. I got how he made decisions and what data he tracked. At
seven and eight, I realized I didn’ t need his help anymore. I had
learned how to run paid ads, at least on Facebook, like a pro. And,
if I had to make a guess, it was because I learned it…from a pro.
 
In this chapter , we explore a not-so-obvious-but-much-better -way
to use agencies to get more leads. Let’ s get crankin’.
 
 

How Agencies W ant Y ou T o Think They W ork
 
Advertising agencies are lead-getting service businesses. Y ou pay
them to run paid ads, do outreach, or package and distribute
content.
 
For example, let’ s say you want to post free video content. But,
you know nothing about making video content or how to distribute
it. Y ou’d need to learn how to pick video topics, record videos, edit
videos, make thumbnail images, and write headlines. Or , you’d
need to hire the people who do. Enter the agency . They say they’ve
hired and trained people to do that stuf f already . So they promise
faster , better , and more cost-ef ficient results than you could get on
your own. And as soon as I had enough money , it felt compelling
enough.
 
After my first experience with an agency , that I mentioned earlier
and went quite well, I decided to use more. But my experience
with the next ten plus agencies was differ ent  because I used them
‘the right way .’ Each went something like this:
 
Step 1: They got me excited about all the new leads they would
bring.
 
Step 2: I’d go through an onboarding process that felt valuable
(and sometimes was). 
 
Step 3: They assigned their “best” senior rep to my account. 
 
Step 4: I saw some results.
 
Step 5: They moved my senior rep to the newest customer ...
 

Step 6: A junior rep starts managing my account. My results
suf fered.
 
Step 7: I complained.
 
Step 8: The senior rep would come back once in a while to make
me feel better .
 
Step 9: Results still suf fered. And I’d eventually cancel.
 
Step 10: I’d search for another agency and repeat the cycle of
insanity .
 
Step 1 1: For the zillionth time –Start wondering why I wasn’ t
getting results like the first time.
 
 
T o be clear , like the introduction to this chapter shows, agencies
can  play a valuable role in business growth. But not the way they
want you to. I don't want anyone else falling into the same trap. In
fact, I hope all the money I wasted goes towards paying down your
ignorance tax too. So keep reading.
 
It’ s frankly ridiculous that it took me so many years to figure out
that I actually used an agency the right  way…the first  time! But
now , after playing their game so many times, I feel I cracked the
“how to use an agency” code. And it doesn’ t come from playing
their game at all . It comes from playing a dif ferent one. And this
chapter breaks it all down in three steps:
 
1 . Hiring an agency versus doing it yourself
 

2 . How I use agencies now . And how you can, too.
 
3 . How to pick the right agency
 
 
Hiring An Agency V ersus Doing It Y ourself
 
First, let’ s get this out of the way . Good agencies cost money . So if
you have no money , then agencies are out of the question. Y ou’ve
gotta learn through trial and error . And that’ s no big deal. W e all
start that way . But if you do have some money , I suggest using
agencies for two things: learning new methods and learning new
platforms.
 
If I want to learn new ways to do content, outreach, or paid ads,
then I hire agencies of fering new ways to do them. They’ve
already made the big mistakes. So instead of wasting time figuring
it out myself, I skip straight to the ‘make money’ part. I like the
‘make money’ part.
 
I also use agencies when I want to start advertising on a platform I
don't understand. I make money faster because they do the early
setup and maintenance for me and because I get them to teach me
how to do it.
 
Hiring an agency is all about investing in important skills you can’ t
really learn anywhere else. That is, unless you go through all  the
trial and error to learn it yourself. And if you did, you lose the
time, and attention you could have used to learn the other
important stuf f that scales your business. And scaling your
business is the whole point.
 

Action Step: As soon as you have enough money for a good
agency , start poking around. If you follow the rest of the steps in
this chapter , you’ll make it all back… and then some.
 
 
How I Use Agencies Now . And How Y ou Can T oo.
 
I’ve become a little more sophisticated than the story I told at the
beginning. Here’ s how I use agencies now . Rather than believe the
lie that “I’ll never have to learn this stuf f because they can do it,” I
start every agency relationship with a purpose and a deadline to
fulfill it. I open by saying:
 
“I want to do what you do in my business, but I don’ t know how .
I’d like to work with you for 6 months so I can learn how you do it.
Plus, I’ll pay extra for you to br eak down why you make the
decisions you do and the steps you take to make them. Then, after I
get a good idea of how it all works, I’ll start training my team on
it. And once they can do it well enough, I’d like to change to a
lower cost consulting arrangement. This way , you can still help us
if we run into pr oblems. Ar e you opposed to this?”
 
In my experience, most agencies are not  opposed to this. And if it
doesn't work for them, that’ s perfectly fine. Just move on to the
next agency . But, before you start kicking everyone to the curb, be
willing to negotiate. At some price, it’ s worth it for both of you.
V iva capitalism!
 
This is how I use agencies now . Like when I wanted to learn
Y ouT ube, I actually hired two  agencies. The first, I hired to keep
me committed to making videos while they did some legwork on
the platform itself. The second I hired (at 4x the price) to really
teach us the in-depth ideas behind making the best content

possible. And once our videos beat their videos, we dropped down
to consulting only .
 
I’ve used this method again and again. I hire one “good enough”
agency to learn the ropes of a new platform. Then, I hire a more
elite agency to learn how to maximize it– and I cannot r ecommend
this strategy enough.
 
If you are upfront about your intentions and the agency agrees, you
get the best of both worlds. Y ou get better short-term results
because they (probably) know more than you. And, you get better
long-term results because you learn how to do it yourself or your
team learns to do it for you. Y ou also spend the maximum amount
of time with their best r eps .
 
Remember , you only get a fraction  of the agency’ s attention, so
results get worse whenever they get new clients. Meanwhile, your
team gets better and better because they stay focused on you full-
time. So compare your team’ s results to the agency’ s until you beat
them. Then, cancel the relationship and put the money into scaling
everything you just learned.
 
Action Step: When you find an agency to work with (next step)
set terms with them and deadlines for yourself. Use the template
above as your guide. And feel OK with negotiating a bit to make it
work.
 

 
 
How to Pick The Right Agency
 
 
After working with tons of bad agencies, and a handful of good
ones, I created a list of what all the good ones had in common.
Now it isn’ t the last word on what makes a good agency , but it is
useful stuf f that’ s worked for me.
 
Here’ s what I look for:

 
1)  Somebody I know got good results working with them. If you
only know about an agency from their paid ads or cold
outreach… they probably aren’ t as good as the ones who rely
solely on word of mouth (and the best ones do).
 
2)  Prominent companies got good results working with them. I may
not know the companies personally , but if I recognize them, it’ s
a good sign.
 
3)  A waiting list. When demand for a service exceeds the supply ,
they are probably pretty good.
 
4)  A clear sales process that makes a point to set realistic
expectations. No funny business. 
 
5)  No short term hacks. They keep the talk on long term strategy .
They also give clear timelines for setup, scaling, and results.
 
6)  They tell me exactly what they need from me, when they need it,
and how they use it.
 
7)  They  suggest a regular schedule of  meetings and of fer several
ways to update me on their progress.
 
8)  They give updates in simple terms and have clear ways to track
so I know how costs compare with results.
 
9)  They make a good of fer:
 
a . Dream outcome : is what they promise what I want?
 

b . Perceived likelihood of achievement : how many other
people like me have they gotten there?
 
c . T ime delay : how long will it take?
 
d . Ef fort and sacrifice : what do they require me to do when
working with them? What will I have to give up? Can I
stick with those for a long time?
 
10)       They are expensive. All good agencies are expensive… but
not all expensive agencies are good. So talk with as many as it
takes. And use this list as a guide to find the good ones.
 
…if an agency checks those boxes, they’re worth considering.
 
 

Action step: Even if an agency agrees to your terms, talk with a
few more before you make a decision. Compare them using the
checklist above, and then pick the best one for you.
 
 
Conclusion
 
Even though this isn’ t the “traditional” agency model, both
businesses benefit. They get a customer they otherwise wouldn't
have. And we get a money-making skill for life. In the story at the
beginning of the chapter - it cost me eight hours and $6000 to learn
a skill that’ s  made me millions . Does that seem worth it to you? It
better .
 
And to make this agency method work at scale, you have to count
on a good amount of time where you pay the agency and your team
to do the same stuff . Y ou’ve gotta give yourself some breathing
room to get results from the agency , learn what they do, and  train
your team on it... all at once. Y es, it costs a lot of money . And yes,
it’ s totally worth it when you get it right.
 
And get it right you can. After agencies put a low level employee
on my account for the millionth time, it finally clicked. This can’ t
be that  hard.  At first, it took about a year to get my team better
than an agency . As I got better , it went down to ten months, then
eight. And now , I’ve got it down. I can get my team as good or
better than the agency in less than six months or less. And every
time I want to learn a new method or platform, I repeat the process.
 
The better you get, the cheaper it becomes, and the more money
you make. Funny , that sounds a lot like advertising.
 
 

Next Steps:
 
1)  Decide if using an agency makes sense for you right now .
 
2)  T alk to a lot of agencies to get a feel for the market. Don’ t be
cheap. 
 
3)  Use the agreement framework I outlined.
 
4)  Set a clear deadline to force you (and your team) to learn the
skills.
 
5)  Use both teams until yours beats theirs regularly .
 
6)  Switch to discounted consulting until you feel like you’re
teaching them instead of them teaching you…then cut ‘em
loose.
 
 
Now that we know how to profit from the high risk world of
agencies, we explore the lead-getter that’ s made me the most
money . W e recruit an army of businesses who can get us even
more leads - affiliates .
