“It’ s not the end. It’ s not even the beginning of the end. But it is,
per haps, the end of the beginning”
-W inston Chur chill
 
 
June 2017. Thr ee months after we lost it all, again, and switched
Gym Launch to licensing.
 
“Hey Leila, what do you make of this?” I asked.
 
“What’ s up?”
 
I gave her my phone.
 

Mr . and Mrs. Hormozi, we cor dially invite you to a private event
for entr epr eneurs earning eight figur es and up. Let me know if
you’r e inter ested.
 
“Seems cool” she said. “...but we’re not making eight figures?”
 
I pretended not to hear her . “Y ou wanna go?”
 
“Sure. Is it included in our mentorship dues?”
 
“One sec, I’ll ask”
 
An email response came a moment later:
 
No, this is an additional fee. It is a two-day event limited to ten
people at a private r esort.
 
“Nope” I said.
 
“Huh. Can we af ford to go?”  Ouch.
 
“Who cares? W e can’ t af ford not to go.”
 
10 days, a long flight, and a short drive later…
 
W e made it. The “cool kids” meet up. I had one goal, to add as
much value as I could to everyone else in the room. But the
moment I walked in, I knew I was out of my league. I recognized
almost everyone there. They were famous in the advertising world.
They all spoke at huge events. Signed autographs. Made millions.

Then, there was me. I wasn’ t an eight-figure entrepreneur . I was a
kid from Baltimore just paying to breathe everyone else’ s air .
 
Once everyone settled we had a short housekeeping discussion and
then got down to business. This way of doing things was a sharp
contrast to the big stages, booming sound systems, flashing lights,
and other theatrics that “real” events have.
 
The first speaker was ready to go. He had a ‘man bun’ and loose
yoga-ish clothing. He looked like a hippie. But then, he opened
with how he was only  doing $3,000,000 per month… is this for
r eal!? I felt like a fraud. The numbers he shared with such a casual
attitude blew my mind. How is this possible?
 
He continued on with his talk using all sorts of business,
advertising, and tech jar gon. He pointed to dizzying charts and
graphs. I came here to learn more about advertising but felt dumber
by the second. I recognized enough of the words to realize I knew
nothing useful about them. His presentation went way  over my
head. I started sweating bullets. Leila grabbed my hand. W e both
felt stressed and out of our depths.
 
He finished and finally opened up for Q&A. Excellent . But the
questions were still at the same level as his presentation. Nope, I’m
still doomed.  Then, an awkward voice cracked.“So uhh… What
courses are you taking to learn all this stuf f?” Now we’r e talking.  I
leaned in. Pen in hand. His answer changed my life:
 
“At this point, I don’ t expect to learn anything new from courses. I
have to learn by doing. And I ‘do’ by spending a percentage of my
revenue to test new campaigns, new channels, new pages, or just
plain crazy ideas. And I learn something every time I test, so the
money is well spent. Whenever one of these tests is a winner , and
some  are, it’ s a big deal. I learn something amazing and make far

more money than I spent. It raises the bar for my business and,
more importantly , myself. So whether it's 1%, 5%, or 10%, set
some per centage of your advertising budget aside to try new things
without expecting a return. Consider it an investment in your
education.”
 
I felt chills go through me like some judgment demon left my
body . He gave me permission to fail.
 
None of this is magic. If he can do this, so can I.
 
***
 
The next week, I tripled  my advertising budget. Y es, it was a bit
aggressive. But my mindset had completely changed. I’d either
make more, or get better:
 
Our business went from $400,000 in June to $780,000 in July .
From there, my cost to get customers went up too high. So I tried
new audiences. Most failed. Then, a hit. Boom, we cruised past
$1M to $1.2M to $1.5M per month.
 
Then, I realized we didn’ t follow up with our engaged leads… at
all. W e tested email. Didn’ t work. W e tested phone calls. Nothin’.
Then I tried text blasts. Wham, we zoomed to $1.8M the next
month.
 
From there, we tested paid ads like crazy . W e made way more of
them and  put more focus on their production value. Boom. W e
cruised past $2.5M per month.
 

Then, we launched our af filiate program and stacked another
$1.5M per month on top . That took us past $4m per month. Y ears
later , our portfolio now does more than $16,000,000 per month.
 
So test until you find something that works. T ake massive action.
Stay focused. Double down on it until it breaks. Then test until you
find the next thing that works, and double down on that.  T aking
these leaps are the only way to unlock the business you want and
the life that comes with it. And maybe, slay your judgment demon
too.
 
So from now on…
 
Y ou either win or you learn.
 
 
The End of the Beginning
 
Y our speed to making big money depends on how fast you learn
the skills to making big money . Getting more engaged leads with
the skills of advertising, is a great start to making more money . In
fact, if you make any  amount of money , more engaged leads will
make you even more. And, sadly , those skills take time to learn.  So
I share my experiences to shave years of f your time. T o shorten the
gap between no money and mo’ money . It’ s time to make it
happen.
 
 
Outline Of The “Get Started” Section
 
This final section has three chapters. They are short and sweet, just
like our time together .

 
In the first chapter , Advertising in real life– I’ll lay out my one big
advertising rule. Then, I’ll give you my personal one-page
advertising plan you can use to get more engaged leads, today .
 
In the next chapter , Putting It all T ogether– I’ll lay out the roadmap
to scale from your first few leads all the way to your $100M Leads
machine.
 
Finally , A Decade In Page–I’ll distill everything we learned into
bullets to show how far we’ve come in our time together . Then, to
send you on your way , I’ll share a parable that has gotten me
through even my hardest times.

If some is good, mor e is better .
 
 
June 2014.
 
When I launched my first gym, I used the same paid ads I used at
Sam’ s gym from way back. And they worked, for a while. Over
time, the costs started creeping up. I got less leads for the same
money . But, I still needed more customers. I wasn’ t sure what to
do.
 
I talked to a mentor who ran a chain of tanning salons for some
advice. He said “before all this fancy internet stuf f, flyers crushed
for us, you should try those.” So, try them we did. W e printed 300.
Over the next day , we put them on cars in areas close to the gym.
A day passed. Nothing. The next day , the phone rang. Finally!
 
“Hey , you put a flyer on my car–” My heart raced. It worked!
 

“–Y es, yes I did! How can I–?” But before I could finish, he
interrupted right back.
 
“–yea, you scratched my Mercedes…” Crap. “...you’re gonna need
to pay for–” I panicked and hung up the phone. He called back. I
let it ring. He never called again. That was the only call I got from
the flyers. No leads. Nothing.
 
Universe: 1. Alex: 0.
 
 
A few weeks later
 
I sat in the lobby of my gym waiting for customers to fall into my
lap. Feeling bored, and a bit frustrated, I called the mentor with the
‘bright idea’ to put out flyers.
 
“Hey Alex - how's it going?”
 
“Uh, not too good.”
 
“Why what's up?”
 
“W e put out the flyers like you said.”
 
“Oh yea, how many leads you get from ‘em?”
 
“None.”
 
“Hmm…that’ s odd.” He paused. “What was your test size?”

 
“What do you mean?”
 
“Y ou know , how many did you put out?”
 
“I put out 300.” I said in a resentful tone.
 
“Shoot, you only put out 300? Hard to know if anything works
with such a small number…I test with 5000. Then when we find a
winner , we put out 5000 per day , every day , for a month…”
 
Five  thousand ? He tests  with almost seventeen times more than my
entire “campaign.” And he does it in a single day . I felt like the
person who says exercise doesn’ t work after going to the gym one
time. And I hate  that person.
 
“...I mean what kind of response did you think you were gonna
get?” he chuckled. “If we get half a percent, that’ s decent. If we get
one percent, that’ s a winner . W ith 300 flyers, half a percent would
be like one and a half people. That makes it pretty hard to know if
you got a winner or not.”
 
I had nothing to say . He was right. I felt like a fool .
 
I doubt he remembers the call. But, it stuck with me. I promised
myself I would never  let ef fort be the reason anything  didn't work
for me. It could be something else. The of fer . The copy . The image.
The tar geting. The media. The platform. The position of the moon.
But not. my . effort.
 

Those 300 measly flyers taught me a mondo lesson. I did the right
stuf f, but I didn't do it enough times. I lacked what can be
described in a single word: volume.
 
Neil Strauss once said “Success comes down to doing the obvious
thing for an uncommonly long period of time without convincing
yourself you’re smarter than you are.” The right action in the
wrong amount still fails. Most people, myself included, stop too
soon . W e don’ t do enough.
 
Most people dramatically underestimate the volume it takes to
make advertising work. They're not doing half as much or a third
as much as is required. In fact, they're doing dramatically less. I
was doing 1/1500th the level of ef fort required to make a flyer
campaign work– I just didn't know it.
 
I hear this all the time. “Alex, I reached out to 100 people over the
last six weeks, I only got one customer , it doesn’ t work.”
Response: “Y ou did 1/42 of the amount of work required. It was
100 per day , not 100 over time.”
 
Most people do not get that advertising is an inputs and outputs
game. T o them, outputs appear out of their control. Their low ef fort
inputs get them their low and unreliable output of engaged leads.
