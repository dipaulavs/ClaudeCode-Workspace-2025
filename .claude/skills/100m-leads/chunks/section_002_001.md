“It’ s har d to be poor with leads bangin’ down your door” -
Hormozi family jingle
 
 
Y ou have to sell stuf f to make money . It seems simple enough, but
everyone tries to skip to the ‘make money’ part. It doesn’ t work. I
tried. Y ou need all  the pieces. Y ou need the stuf f to sell - an of fer .
Y ou need people to sell it to - leads. Then you gotta get those
people to buy it - sales. Once you put all those in place, then you
can make money .
 
My first book, $100M Offers, covers the first step and gives you
the stuff . It answers the age old question “What should I sell?.”
Answer - an of fer so good people feel stupid saying no. But
strangers can only buy your stuf f if they know you exist. This takes
leads. “Leads” mean a lot of dif ferent things to a lot of dif ferent

people. But most agree that they’re the first step to getting more
customers. In simpler terms, it means they’ve got the problem to
solve and the money to spend.
 
If you’re reading this book, you already know leads don’ t
magically appear . Y ou need to go get them. More precisely , you
need to help them find you so they can buy your stuf f! And the
best part is, you don’ t have to wait…you can for ce  them to find
you. Y ou do that through advertising. Advertising ,  the pr ocess of
making known , lets strangers know about the stuf f you sell. If more
people know about the stuf f you sell, then you sell more stuf f. If
you sell more stuf f, then you make more money . Having lots of
leads makes it har d to be poor .
 
Advertising lets you have a terrible product... and still make
money . It lets you be terrible at sales…and still make money . It lets
you make a ton of mistakes and still. make. money . In short, having
this skill gives you endless chances to get it right .
 
And in the unfor giving world of business, second chances are hard
to come by . So you might as well load up. Advertising is a skill
worth having .
 
And this book, $100M Leads , shows you exactly  how to do it.
 
***
 
$100M Leads  sits atop the foundation of my first book, $100M
Offers . It assumes you already have a Grand Slam Offer to sell -
the stuf f. Once you have an of fer to sell, it creates the next
problem– Who do I sell it to? This book is my answer to that
question. Leads. Lots of leads.
 

And before you know how to get leads, life sucks.  Y ou don’ t know
where your next customer will come from. Y ou scramble to cover
rent and pay bills. Y ou worry about laying people of f, putting food
on your table and… going under . Y ou work your hardest to
succeed, and others laugh at you for trying. It feels like death. I’ve
been there. I get it. This book puts you in a better situation. One
where you’ve got more leads than you can handle and more money
than you can spend.
 
Here’ s How:
 
First, it explains how advertising works.
 
Second, it reveals the four core ways to get leads.
 
Third, it shows you how to get other people to do it for you.
 
Finally , it wraps up with a one-page advertising plan you can use
to grow your business today .
 
***
 
Once you know how to get leads, life gets easier .
 
As for why you should blindly listen to me about getting more
leads - don’ t. Make up your own darn mind! But, in the spirit of
“walking the talk,” here’ s my track record:
 
I advertise in a variety of industries through my holding company
Acquisition.com. Our portfolio includes software, e-commerce,
business services, consumer services, brick & mortar chains,

digital products, and plenty of others. T ogether , they make
$250,000,000+ in annual revenue. And they do it by getting
20,000+ leads per day selling of fers from $1 to $1,000,000+.
 
On the personal side, I have a lifetime average return on
advertising of 36:1. That means for every $1 I spend on
advertising, I get $36 back. A return of 3600%. Some people built
their wealth in the stock market. Others in real estate. I built mine
advertising.
 
This year I surpassed $100,000,000 in net worth at age 32. And if
you’re from the future, that’ s in 2022 US Dollars. Which, much to
my dismay , came with no flyers. No awards. No parades. I’m still
2000x poorer than the richest man in the world. My life is pretty
much the same. I’m still the same height, married to the same
woman, and graying faster than when I was poor .
 
In these pages, I share the skills responsible for the bulk of my
material success. I did it all using the advertising methods in this
book. I left nothing out. This isn’ t a book of theories or armchair
analysis. This book is built on what worked for me. And I wrote it
hoping it’ll work even better for you.
 
T o answer a question I got after releasing my first book: "Why do
your books look like they’re written for kids?" The answer is
simple: my books must be books I would read. And I have a short
attention span. As such, I liken my reading preferences to that of a
child: short in length, simple in words, and with lots of pictures.
These books are my attempt to do that.
 
$100M Leads is about getting strangers to show interest in the stuf f
you sell. And once I transfer that skill to you, it’ s your turn to use
it. 

 
W ith that out of the way…let's get rich, shall we?

“Hope is being able to see the light despite all the darkness” -
Desmond T utu
 
Mar ch 2017.
 
I felt hurried taps on my shoulder while working at my desk. It was
Leila, my (then) girlfriend and business partner .
 
“What’ s up? Y ou alright?”
 
“W e have a problem.” She said.
 
What now?  I thought.
 
“Look at this.” She shoved a stack of books out of the way to make
room for her laptop.
 
“What am I looking at?” I squinted.
 
“A disaster .”
 
She ran her finger down the screen to direct my gaze.
 
-$99… -$499…-$499… -$299…-$399… -$499…-$499…
 
Every other number was more than my rent.

 
“What are these?”
 
She started scrolling. “Refunds. All of them. From the two gyms
we launched last month.”
 
“W ait. How? Why?”
 
She scr olled mor e.  “I got lots of weird texts last night from the
members we sold at the Kentucky gym. I guess the owner stood up
on a chair and told everyone to refund and go home. He didn’ t
want to deal with all the new customers.”
 
"That's insane," I said.
 
She was still scr olling.  "Y eah, and the other gym owner told his
new customers he would take them for half price if they asked for
refunds from us and paid him instead.”
 
“W ait what? They can’ t do that.” I said.
 
“W ell, they did.” She scr olled faster , the numbers blurr ed .
 
“Have you called them? That’ s not allowed in the agreement." I
said.
 
“Y ea. I know . They’re ignoring my calls.”
 
I put my hand on hers. The refund waterfall froze in place.
Hundreds of droplet-size reminders of how much I sucked.

 
“How bad is this? How many refunds? Just cutting profits? Or
enough to go negative and owe money?” I tried to keep my voice
steady . I failed.
 
Leila paused before answering. “It’ s a hundred and fifty grand.”
The number hung in the air .  “...we won’ t be able to pay my
friends.”
 
Their faces flashed through my mind, and the little hope I had
drained from my chest. A month earlier , I got her friends to quit
their jobs for this. Now I had to tell them I didn’ t have the money
to pay them.
 
She continued. “W e can’ t sell our way out of this either . It’ll just
create more refunds to deal with. And we’re out of money .” Her
eyes met mine, looking for the answers she deserved. I had
nothing.
 
I felt sick.
 
 
A year earlier-
 
I was good at getting leads for my gyms. I scaled to five locations
in only three years. My claim to fame was opening my gyms up at
full capacity on the first day . So, I opened as many as I could as
fast as I could.
 
My fast pace started getting attention. I got asked to speak at a
conference about my advertising method. T o me though, I didn’ t
think my process was special. I figured everyone was doing it. So,

I walked through my presentation hoping I wasn’ t boring the
audience. They were silent.
 
The moment I stepped of f stage, a mob formed around me. They
hurled questions at me left and right. I could barely keep up. They
even followed me into the bathroom. I felt like a celebrity . It was
wild. T o this day , I’ve never been more bombarded in my life.
Everyone wanted me to teach them how to do what I had just
presented. They wanted my help. Me. But I had nothing to sell
them. Although, over one hundred people left me their phone
numbers and business cards in case I did. Then a wild idea came to
me.
 
I could make some money doing this…
 
3 months later–an idea turns into a business
 
Since I used advertising to launch my gyms at full capacity I
thought, maybe, I could “launch” other people’ s gyms to full
capacity , too. I called the company Gym Launch. Original, I know .
 
My of fer was simple. I’ll fill your gym in 30 days for fr ee. Y ou pay
nothing. I pay for everything. I sell new members and keep the first
6 weeks of membership fees as payment. Y ou get everything else. If
I don’ t fill your gym, I don’ t make money . Y ou spend nothing either
way .
 
It was an easy of fer to sell. I’d fly out. T urn on my lead machine.
W ork the leads. Then sell the leads. Except, instead of selling them
into my gym, I’d sell them into whatever gym I was camped at for
the month. Every month I’d go to a new gym. Rinse and repeat. It
worked.
 

W ord of this kid who’d fill your gym for free got around fast.
Unless I hired help, referrals would’ve booked me out for more
than two years straight. I couldn’ t keep running my gyms and
doing this, so I sold my gyms and went all in on Gym Launch.
 
I saw a problem though. I filled their gyms, and they  got to keep all
the long-term profits. I left so much money on the table. But, if I
were part owner of some of the gyms, I could stack revenue month
over month. Bingo . Not much later , one of the gym owners made
such an of fer . W e’d be fifty-fifty . I would fill the gym with
members, and he would fill it with staf f. W ith this new model, I
could open up 1 to 2 gyms per month and own them all. This
would work much better than only collecting the upfront cash. A
win-win partnership.
 
A slight hitch in the plan, though. My new partner had “poor
financials.” So nice guy Alex of fered to pay all the expenses and
take on all the liability for the first launch. I personally guaranteed
the lease and would spend my  time and money to fill it with
members. Once filled, I would hand the gym over to him. I put all
the money from selling my gyms, including my life savings, into
this "launch and go" model. It took everything I had.
 
A few weeks later , halfway through the launch, I woke up to find
all the money in the account gone. All of it. The partner accused
me of stealing and took the money as “his share” of the profits.
But, we hadn’ t made any pr ofit . Then, he sent the money to a
foreign contact and filed for bankruptcy . That's what he told me
anyway . When I of fered to walk through the financials and account
for every dollar , he refused. That’ s when I knew I had made a
terrible mistake.
 
It turns out he had been indicted for fraud a few years earlier . And
to make matters worse, I alr eady knew . He told me it was “just a

big misunderstanding.” I believed him. As the saying goes, when
money meets experience... the money gets the experience, and the
experience gets the money . Lesson learned.
 
In three months, I went from a successful multi-location gym
owner . T o selling all my gyms. T o a cool new launching gyms
thing. T o completely broke. Everything I made from selling my
gyms was gone. My life savings was gone. W iped out. All of it.
Four years of work, saving, sleeping on the floor– erased in a…oh
no… Leila .
 
Leila quit her life as she knew it to do this with me. She weathered
my constant changes. She supported me in the half-baked
partnership even though she opposed it. Even with this huge
failure, she never once even hinted, I told you so . Instead, she told
me, “The Gym Launch model is still good. Let’ s do more of
those.” So we did.
 
I put $3,300 per day  on a credit card to pay for ads, airfare, hotels,
rental cars, etc. for six sales reps. Leila’ s friends. I say this lightly ,
but I covered what a nightmare it was in the first book. So I won’ t
repeat it here.
 
In the first month, we launched six gyms and collected $100,1 17.
W e made enough to cover the $100,000 credit card bill. And for
the record, that meant I was still broke. The next month we made
$177,399 with $30,000-$40,000 in profit. It gave me some room to
breathe. Finally .
 
 
And that’ s when Leila tapped me on the shoulder to share
$150,000 worth of bad news.
 

Now you’re caught up.
 
 
The morning after Leila told me we had $150,000 in refunds and
lost all our money . Again.
 
A honking horn startled me at 3 AM. My problems flooded back.
W elp. I’m awake now . I pulled myself out of bed and slinked to my
work corner . I walked over out of habit more than desire. I slid the
chair out and plopped down - notebook and pen at the ready . I had
to make $150,000 in profit, not revenue, in thirty days. And I had
to do it with no money to my name, and no experience making that
much profit in a month. Ever .  So I started scribbling ideas:
 
…Char ge an upfr ont fee for new gyms
 
…Ask for a per centage of r evenue fr om old gyms
 
…Get gyms I alr eady launched to pr e-pay for a futur e launch
 
…Call every old customer and sell them supplements over the
phone
 
I kept penciling the math. None of these would make enough
money . Not in thirty days anyway . I felt glued to the chair . I have
to figur e this out . I stared at the notebook, hoping it knew
something. It didn’ t. God I suck .
 
A few hours later , Leila woke up. Like clockwork, she walked into
the kitchen and poured a cup of cof fee. She got straight to work at
the kitchen table behind me. 

 
“Whatcha doin’?” I asked, trying to distract myself.
 
“Check-ins with online fitness clients.” she said.
 
“What does that bring in again?”
 
“$3600 last month.”
 
“What do you char ge?”
 
“300 bucks a month. Why?”
 
“How long does it take you?”
 
“A few hours a week”
 
“And there’ s no overhead? just time?"
 
“Y ea…why?”
 
I plowed on “I know these are old personal training clients, but do
you think you could do it with strangers?”
 
“I don’ t know…probably…what’re you thinking?”.
 
“I think I have something.” I said.
 

“W ait, for what?”
 
“T o come up with the hundred and fifty grand.”
 
“What, my online training? How?” She looked skeptical.
 
“W e just cut the middleman and sell direct. I think I can just run
ads to a sales page that books phone appointments. Then we can
sell the fitness programs we’ve been selling at the gyms, but sell it
as an online program. W e already have the materials. W e already
know the ads work. And there won’ t be any cost to fulfill. Plus, no
more flights. No rentals. No motels. And no gym owner telling
them to refund...”
 
She hesitated. “Y ou think it could work?”
 
“Honestly…no idea. But every day we don’ t do something is one
less day to come up with the money .”
 
She thought hard. “Alright, let’ s do it.”
 
That was all I needed.
 
I worked thirty-eight hours straight to make the of fer go live. A
few hours later , leads started flowing. She took her first call the
next day . I walked in as the call finished:
 
“$499...yea…and what card did you want to use?” she had the
candor of a pr o .
 

A few minutes later , I asked with anticipation, “W as that a sale??”
 
“Y ep.” Dang, she is  a pr o .
 
I even snapped a pictur e of Leila closing our first sale because it
felt so momentous.
 
W ithin days, we were doing $1000 per day in online fitness sales.
W e also got the cash up front with almost no risk of refunds. This
was working . But, we were still way  short of the $150,000.
 
At lunch, she listened to my master plan between mouthfuls.
“Okay , the sales guys can stay home and sell this over the phone. If
they do the same $1000 per day as you, with eight guys, we should
hit $8,000 per day . In thirty days, we’ll make $240,000. After ad
spend and commissions, we'll have enough to cover the $150,000.”
 
“What about the gyms we’re supposed to launch?”
 
“I’ll call 'em and tell ‘em we’re going in another direction. They
haven't paid us anything, so there’ s not much they can object to.
I’ll start calling them after lunch.”
 
The first call was to a gym owner in Boise, Idaho.
