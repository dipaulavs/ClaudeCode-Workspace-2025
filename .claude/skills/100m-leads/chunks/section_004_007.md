How T o Publicly Advertise to Strangers
 
Advertising is the only casino wher e, with enough skill, you
become the house.
 
 
June 2013.
 
“Let’ s try some Facebook ads for the gym.” I spouted.
 
Sam’ s eyebrow went up. “They don’ t work. I already tried.”
 
Now this was the brief time between quitting my “real job” and
starting my first gym. I wanted some experience. So I cold-emailed
more than 40 gym owners for a chance to shadow them. Sam was
the only one who responded to my pleas for mentorship. He let me

work at his gym, with him , for minimum wage. I’m forever
grateful for that opportunity .
 
“I promise, I really think they’ll work.” I said. “Let me give it a
shot with the stuf f I learned from that workshop last weekend. I’ll
do everything.” That workshop took most of my puny savings.
 
Sam leaned back in his chair , crossing his arms. “I’ll tell you what.
I’ll give you a thousand bucks to play with. If you lose it, then you
have to shut up about this Facebook stuf f. If you make more, I’ll
split the profit with you.”
 
“Deal.”
 
I worked with a freelancer to get everything set up. W e went back
and forth until it was “perfect.” A few days later , I marched into
Sam’ s of fice to show him what I’d made.
 
“It’ s ready .” I said.
 
He spun his laptop to face me. “Alright, Hormozi. Show me what
you’ve got.”
 
I placed the ugliest ad you’ve ever seen:
 
I’M LOOKING FOR 5 CHINO HILLS RESIDENTS T O T AKE
PLACE IN A FREE 6 WEEK CHALLENGE. YOU MUST LET
US USE YOUR BEFORE AND AFTER PICTURES IN OUR
MARKETING IN EXCHANGE FOR THE PROGRAM. CLICK

No images. No videos. No frills. →Just words. ALL CAPS.
 
The ad went live.
 
W e got leads within hours. I called them all and booked
appointments as fast as I could. I also texted them about an hour
before to remind them of our appointment. And as soon as they
walked in, I started yapping about our six week challenge. I had
zero sales skills. My conviction made up for my lack of skill. They
bought.
 
I sold 19 people at $299 each. W e made just under $5700 from the
$1000 investment. T rue to his word, Sam cut me a check and
handed it over . He made it out for $2500. More than my share.
 
“Sam, this is–”
He cut me of f. “Nice work, Hormozi. Do it again .”
 
***
 
The “6 week challenge” became the biggest promotion in the gym
industry . For seven years . It drove at least $1.5B in revenue, more
by now . I taught it to over 4,500 gyms. And I bet more than
10,000+ gyms used versions of the promotion without licensing it.
Maybe you saw ads for it in your local market. And yes, if you’re
curious, it got more sophisticated as time went on.
 
 
How Paid Ads W ork
 

 
Paid ads are a way to advertise one-to-many to cold audiences.
People who don’ t know you. Paid ads work by paying another
person or business to put your of fer in front of their  audience.
Think of it like renting eyeballs or earballs. And because you don’ t
need to spend time building an audience, paid ads are the fastest
way to get the most people to see your stuf f– Y ou trade money for
reach. A considerable advantage when you know what you’r e
doing . Ads are riskier . But, when done right, they can get you more
leads than any other method.
 
W ith warm and cold outreach we have to do more stuf f to reach
more people. T o reach more people with free content, we depend
on the platform or audience sharing it if they feel like it. Paid ads
are dif ferent. The reach is guaranteed . But getting your money
back isn’ t. So it’ s a game of ef ficiency rather than reach. Let me
explain:
 
In principle, if you paid enough money , you could get every person
in the world to see your ad. And, if every person in the world saw
your ad, someone would buy . Even if only by accident (ha). So the
question isn’ t “do ads work?” it’ s “ how well  can you make them
work?” In other words, it’ s a push and pull between how much you
spend and how much they buy .
 

And like cold outreach, paid ads go to colder lower trust audiences.
So even with good of fers, a smaller percentage of people will
respond. And like cold outreach, paid ads get over this hurdle by
putting your of fer in front of more people. And if an ad isn’ t
profitable, most of the time, it’ s because the right people never saw
it . So to make an ad profitable, the right people have  to  see it. This
keeps our ads ef ficient.
 
This chapter reveals how I create more ef ficient paid ads by
finding needles in the haystack. I start with the entire world as my
audience (haystack) then narrow down to get a higher percentage
of engaged leads (needles). First, I pick a platform that contains
my ideal audience. Second, I use whatever tar geting methods that
exist within the platform to find them. Third, I craft my ad in a way
that r epels  anyone else. Finally , I tell whoever ’ s left standing to
take the next step. People overcomplicate it. But that’ s it. That’ s all
we’re doing - narrowing down who sees our ad so we have the
highest chance of getting the right type of people to respond.
 
Once we advertise profitably in a small puddle of an audience, we
expand to a pond, then a lake, then an ocean. And as the audience
gets bigger it does have more of the wrong people, but it has more
of the right ones too. So ads decrease in ef ficiency , but at that point
you can af ford it. In other words, the ratio between what you spend
and how much they buy goes down but the total amount of money
you make goes up. So instead of spending $1000 to make $10,000
with $9000 in profit, you spend $100,000 to make $300,000 with
$200,000 in profit. Y our ratio goes down, but you make more
money . So the risk is higher because you spend more. But so is the
reward. This means we want to make the audience as big as
possible while still turning a profit.
 
Paid ads give us four new problems to solve. Let’ s break them
down together:
 

1)  Knowing where to advertise
 
2)  Getting the right audience to see it
 
3)  Making the best ad for them to see
 
4)  Getting permission to contact them
 
 
Step 1: “But wher e do I advertise?” → Find a platform wher e
these four things ar e true
 
 
Platforms distribute content to an audience. If you’re not familiar
with any available platforms, I invite you to come join me on
planet earth. If you’ve ever consumed content, which you have,
you’ve directly or indirectly used a platform and been a member of
its audience. And wherever there’ s an audience, you can usually
advertise. So if you want to become a great entrepreneur , you have
to learn about them. Here’ s what I look for in a platform I want to
advertise on:
 
I've used it and gotten value from it as a consumer . So I have
some idea how it works.
 
I can tar get people on the platform interested in my stuf f. 
 
I know how to format ads specific to the platform (which I’ll
dive into in step three).

 
I have the minimum amount of money to spend to place an ad.
 
...And yes, platforms change all the time, but these principles stay
the same .
 
 
Action Steps: Start with one platform that meets the four
requirements. And start watching, listening, or reading ads on the
platform as a first step to learning how to make one.
 
 
Step #2: “But how do I get the right people to see it?” →
T arget them
 

 
So if we start with the entire world, which we kinda do, we need to
be a bit more specific. For example, if you choose a platform that
has 100,000,000 users, you’ve already cut out 99% of the world–
right of f the bat. And, if everyone who buys from you speaks
English, you also want to exclude  the audiences within the
platform who don't. If that’ s half the platform’ s users, you’re
already at 99.5% of the world excluded. Specific is good.
 
The right message to the wrong audience will fall on deaf ears. It
doesn’ t matter how good your ads are. If you’re marketing to
Florida residents about a local business in Iowa, it’ s probably not
gonna work. So you have only one goal when tar geting–get the
highest number of people you think will buy your stuf f to see your
ad.
 
W e did our first round of tar geting by selecting our platform. W e
do the second round within  the platform itself. Modern advertising
platforms have two ways to tar get. Y ou can use them separately or
combine them:
 
1)  T ar get a lookalike audience . Modern platforms can show your ad
to an audience that is similar to, and much bigger than, a list you
provide. Advertisers call this a lookalike audience.  Modern
platforms will make lookalike audiences for you so long as you
upload their minimum list size. The bigger the list and the higher

quality the contacts, the more responsive the lookalike audience
will be. Start with your list of current and previous customers. If
your customer list is big enough to meet the platform minimum,
use it. If it’ s not big enough, add your warm reach out list. If it’ s
still not big enough, add your cold reach out leads to hit the
minimum. This is exactly what I do. Forcing the list to the right
size sometimes makes the lookalike audience too broad. And
that’ s OK because you can…
 
2)  T ar get with factors of your choosing.  T ar geting options include:
age, income, gender , interests, time, location, etc. For example,
if you know no one over forty-five or below twenty-five has
ever bought your thing, then exclude anyone outside that range.
If you sell car parts then show your ad during  car shows and on
car channels. If only people with pets buy your thing, then
include pets as an interest. Basic filters on top of the platform-
generated lookalike audience are a simple way to get more of
the right people to see your ads. End result: more ef ficient ads.
 
 
The more filters you use, the more specific the list. The more
specific the list, the more ef ficient your ads but the faster you will
“burn” through it. However , this specificity sets you up to get more
wins early on. The wins from smaller specific audiences now give
you the money to advertise to lar ger and broader audiences later .
This is how you scale.

 
Action Steps: Bring all your lead lists together into one place.
Separate them by past and previous customers, warm outreach, and
cold outreach. Eventually , you’ll have a list of people that engaged
with your paid ads by giving you contact information but didn’ t
buy . That’ll come in handy . Then, if the platform allows, use these
lists in order of quality to create your lookalike audience. Then, if
the platform also allows, add filters on top of your lookalike
audience to tar get an even higher percentage of people to engage
with your ad. If you are incapable of making a lookalike audience,
then simply start by tar geting interests.
 
 
Step #3 “But what should my ad say?” → Call Out + V alue +
Call to Action (CT A)
 
T o this day , I don’ t change the channel when I see an ad. I rarely
mute ads or skip ads. In fact, I have no premium subscriptions that
remove ads on any media platforms either . Main reason: I want to
consume the ads. I want  to see how businesses do three things. 1)
How they call out  their ideal customers. 2) How they present the
value elements . 3) How they give their audience a call to action .
When I look at ads this way , it turns what was once an everyday
nuisance (ads) into a continuous learning experience. Consuming
ads on purpose, with the core elements in mind, makes me a better
advertiser . And it will make you a better one too.
 
Let’ s use the three chunks to make an ad.
 
1)  Call Outs - I need to get them to notice my ad 
 
2)  V alue - I need to get them interested in what I have to of fer
 

3)  Calls to Action - I need to tell them what to do next
 
 
1) Call Out: People noticing your ad is the most important part of the
ad…by a lot .
The purpose of each second of the ad is to sell the next second of the
ad. And the headline is the first sale . As David Ogilvy says “After
you’ve written your headline, you’ve spent eighty cents of your
advertising dollar .” Focus your ef fort front to back. As crazy as this
sounds (and all the pros are nodding their heads), my advertising
became 20x more ef fective when I focused the majority of my ef fort
on the first five seconds. W e need the audience’ s eyes and ears just
long enough for them to realize “this is for me, I’ll keep paying
attention.” This “first impression” is the part of the ad I test the most .
 
Imagine you’re at a cocktail party in a big ballroom. Lots of people
talking in groups. Loud music playing in the background. In all that
noise, a single sound pierces through it all and you turn around.
W anna know the sound? Y our name. Y ou hear it, and instantly  look
for the source.
 
Scientists call it the ‘cocktail party ef fect’. In simple terms, even when
there’ s tons of stuf f going on, a single thing can still catch and hold
our attention. So our goal with callouts is to harness the cocktail party
ef fect and cut through all  the noise. After all, if they never notice your
ad, nothing else matters.
 
A callout  is whatever you do to get the attention of your audience.
Call outs go from hyperspecific - to get one person’ s attention - to not
at all specific - to get everyone’ s attention. Let me explain. If someone
drops a tray of dishes, everyone  looks. If a child yells “MOM!”, then
the moms  look. If someone says your name, only you  look. But again,
they all get attention. And I try to make my call outs specific enough
to get the right people and  broad enough to get as many of them as I

can. So pay close attention to how advertisers use call outs, especially
the ones tar geting your audience.
 
Here’ s what I look for with verbal callouts- using wor ds to get
attention:
 
1)  Labels : A word or set of words putting people into a gr oup . These
include features, traits, titles, places, and other descriptors. Ex:
*Clark County Moms* *Gym Owners* *Remote W orkers* *I’m
looking for XYZ* etc. T o be most ef fective, your ideal customers
need to identify with the label.
 
a)   People automatically identify with their local area. So with
local ads, the more local, the better . A local ad with “LOCAL
AREA + TYPE OF PERSON” callout is still  one of my all-
time favorite ways to get someone’ s attention. It worked two
hundred years ago, it works today , and it’ll work tomorrow .
So think: Americans < T exans < Dallas Residents < Irving
Residents. If you live in Irving, you’ll immediately think this
ad could af fect you. So, it catches your attention.
 
2)  Y es-Questions : Questions where if people answer “yes, that’ s me”
they qualify themselves for the of fer .  Ex: *Do you wake up to pee
more than once a night?* *Do you have trouble tying your shoes?*
*Do you have a home worth over $400,000?*
 
3)  If-Then Statements : If  they meet your conditions then  you help
them make a decision. *If you run over $100,000 per month in ads,
we can save you 20% or more... *If you were born between 1978
and 1986 in Muskogee Oklahoma, you may qualify for a class
action lawsuit…*If you want to XYZ, then pay attention…*
 
4)  Ridiculous Results : Bizarre, rare, or out of the ordinary stuf f
someone would want. *Massage studio books out two years in
advance. Clients furious.* *This woman lost 50 pounds eating
pizza and fired her trainer* *The government is handing out

thousand dollar checks to anyone who can answer three questions*
Etc.
 
Callouts don’ t have to be just words. They can also be noises or
visuals in the environment. Let’ s go back to the cocktail party .
Sure, a dropped tray of dishes would get everyone’ s attention, but
so would the cling*cling*cling* of a knife against a champagne
flute. They both get everyone’ s attention for dif ferent reasons–one
signals an embarrassing disaster and the other signals important
news… but, in either case, everyone still wants to know what
happens next.  So if the platform allows, good advertisers use
verbal and nonverbal callouts together .
 
Here’ s what I look for with nonverbal callouts- using the setting
and spokesperson to get attention:
 
1)  Contrast : Any stuf f that “sticks out” in the first few seconds.
The colors. The sounds. The movements etc. Note what
catches your attention. Ex:
 
a)   A bright shirt almost always gets more attention than a
black or dull shirt. 
 
b)  Attractive people almost always get more attention than
plain looking people. 
 
c)   Moving stuf f almost always gets more attention than
still stuf f.
 
2)  Likeness : Think visually showing  labels–features, traits, titles,
places, and other descriptors that people identify with.
 
a)   People want to work with people who look, talk, and act
in ways familiar to them (and you may not look, talk, or
act in ways familiar to them). So if you serve a broad

customer base use more ethnicities, ages, genders,
personalities etc. in your ads. If you serve a narrow
customer base (ex: medical devices for seniors), then
use people who look like them.
 
i)             Quack like a duck .  If you want to attract ducks,
look like a duck, walk like a duck, and quack like
a duck. If you want to attract plumbers, dress like
a plumber , talk like a plumber , be in a plumbing
environment. Even with the same message, your
ad will do far better if you look the part (or find
people who do).
 
ii)             If you see an ad for doctors, notice the
spokesperson. What age are they? Gender?
Ethnicity? Are they wearing a lab coat? A
stethoscope? Are they in a medical facility? All
these things get a specific type of person
interested in health related products and services
to pay more attention than they would have
otherwise.
 
iii)             Mascots also work well because they don’ t age,
never ask for more money , and never take days
of f. Think Micky Mouse for Disney . The Geico
Gecko. T ony the T iger for Kellogg’ s. The
Michelin Man. etc. A mascot is a great way to
create an enduring spokesperson for your
business.
 
iv)             Advanced:  Whichever likenesses you choose to
use, if it’ s not you, the business becomes less
dependent on you and therefore more sellable.
Y ou also may just be an ugly son of a gun. Plus,
pretty people convert better anyways. Good news
is, it doesn’ t cost much to get a pretty person to

say stuf f to a camera.
 
3)  The Scene:  Think showing  the Y es-Questions and If-Then
statements.
Ex: An ad with…
 
a)   A person tossing and turning in bed calls out people
with sleep troubles.
 
b)  A pear next to an hour glass can call out people with a
pear shaped body .
 
c)   A room full of stuf f stacked to the ceiling calls out
people with too much junk.
 
d)  A rock hitting a window calls out people with broken
windows.
 
e)   A local landmark. Locals think - “Hey , I know that
place!” and pay attention.
 
Now , this isn’ t an exhaustive list. Far  from it. I show you these to
pull back the curtain. This way , you can see the infinite ways
advertisers cut through the noise, so you can too.
 

 
Action Step:  I’m always impressed with the clever and innovative
ways advertisers call out their prospects. So instead of muting or
hitting “skip ad” look for the call outs . Become a student of the
game. My goal is that for the rest of your life when you see an ad
you turn up the volume.
 
Now , once they’ve noticed our ad, it leads us to the second chunk
of the ad–we need to get them interested…
 
2) Get Them Inter ested.  If people think an of fer or lead magnet has big
benefits and tiny costs, they value it. And they’ll exchange money or
contact information to get it. But if the cost outweighs the benefits,
they don’ t value it, and they won’ t. So the best ads make the benefits
look as big as possible and the costs look as small as possible . This
makes an of fer or lead magnet as valuable as it can be and gets the
most engaged leads because of it. 
 
A good advertisement, paid or not, uses clear and simple ways to
answer the question: why should I be inter ested in your thing?  It tells
people why they should want your lead magnet or of fer . Now , there
are a million ways to do this, but I’ll share with you my What-Who-

When Framework. This mental framework hinges on knowing the
value equation forwards and backwar ds . So all you have to do is
know eight key things about your own product or service: how it
fulfills each element of value for your prospect, and how it helps them
avoid their hidden costs  (remember those?). Think of them like carrots
vs sticks. How your of fer delivers more good stuf f and  less bad stuf f.
Then think of the perspectives of the people who would experience
them (Who). And finally , what time period (When) they’d have these
experiences (positive or negative).
 
 
In the words of David Ogilvy “The customer isn’ t a moron. She’ s
your wife.” So you know what that means? W rite to her . Ads cause
the prospect to think questions to themselves. And a good ad answers
those questions at precisely the time they think it. So if you can
answer what they’re thinking with your ad, using the words they’d
use, you’ve won.
 
So let’ s start with The What:  Eight Key Elements
 

●    Dr eam Outcome : A good ad will show and tell the maximum
benefit the prospect can achieve using the thing you sell. It
should align with the ideal prospect’ s dream outcome for that
sort of product or service. These are the results they
experience after buying the thing.
 
○    Opposite - Nightmar e : A good ad will also show them
the worst possible hassles, pain, etc. of going without
your solution. In short - the bad stuf f they’ll experience
if they don’ t buy .
 
●    Per ceived Likelihood of Achievement : Because of past
failures, we assume that even when we buy , there’ s a risk  we
don’ t get what we want. Lower perceived risk by minimizing
or explaining away past failures, emphasizing the success of
people like them, giving assurances by authority , guarantees,
and how what you have to of fer will at least give them a
better chance of success than what they currently do, etc.
 
○    Opposite - Risk : A good ad will also show them how
risky it is to not  act. What will their life be like if they
carried on as they always have? Show how they will
repeat their past failures and how their problems will
get bigger and  worse…
 
●    T ime Delay : A good ad will also show them how slow their
current trajectory is or that they’ll never  get what they want at
their current rate…
 
○    Opposite - Speed : T o get things we want - we know we
have to spend time getting them. A good ad will show
and tell  how much faster they will get the thing they
want.
 
●    Effort and Sacrifice : A good ad will also show them the
amount of work and skill they’ll need to get the result without
your solution. And, how they’ll be forced to keep giving up

the things they love and continue suf fering from the things
they hate. Or worse, that they work hard and sacrifice a ton
right now… and have gotten… nowher e.  In other words, they
waste more time and money doing what they currently do
than if they just bought our darn solution!
 
○    Opposite - Ease : T o get things we want - we know we
have to change something . But we then assume  we have
to do stuf f we hate and give up stuf f we love. And ease
comes from a lack of needed work  or skill . A good ad
disproves the assumption. It tells and shows how you
can avoid the stuf f you hate doing, do more of the stuf f
you love doing, without working hard, or having a lot of
skill and still  get the dream outcome .
 
Those are the 8 key elements. Now we fully understand The What
– how we deliver the four value elements, and how we avoid their
four opposites. W e now go to the next W - The Who .
 
 
Who : Humans are primarily status driven. And the status of one
human comes from how the other humans treat them. So if your
product or service changes how other people treat your customer ,
which it does in some way , it pays  to show how . And talking about
the value elements from someone else’ s perspective shows all the
ways it'll improve the status of your customer . So we want to
outline two groups of people. The first group is the people gaining
status, your customers. The second group is the people giving it to

them: Spouse, Kids, Parents, Extended Family , Colleagues,
Bosses, Friends, Rivals, Competitors, etc.
 
All of these perspectives give us dif ferent opportunities to show
how the prospect’ s status may improve. And - they give us a ton  of
bonus benefits. As in, if you lose weight, do your kids have a new
role model? Does your spouse now decide to get healthy too? Are
you more likely to get promoted at work? Science says - yes. Does
your frenemy no longer make those little jabs at dinner?
 
Let’ s do business examples. If I said something was risk free, I
want to spell out how their spouse  won’ t nag them about the
purchase since there’ s no risk. I’d talk about how their kids would
notice they weren’ t as stressed or distracted anymore about work.
How their competitors notice their phones don’ t ring as much
because all their customers are flowing to your new customer . How
their business owner buddies say “business must be good” when
they pull up in their new car at the golf range. Y ou get the idea.
These are all added benefits to the prospect we’d miss out on if we
only  looked at it from their own perspective.
 
And, we can apply each new who  perspective to each value driver .
This is how you get so many dif ferent stories, examples, angles,
etc., to describe the benefits (more carrot and less stick).
 
That leads me to the third lens of the What-Who-When framework
- The When .
 


 
When : People often only think of how their decisions af fect the
here and now . But if we want to be extra compelling (and we do),
we should also explain what their decisions led to in the past and
what their decisions could  lead to in the future. W e do this by
getting them to visualize through their own timeline (past–present–
future). This way , we help them to see the consequences of their
decision (or indecision) right now .
 
Let’ s use the weight loss example from earlier fr om their
perspective . W e’d show them getting teased as a kid (past)
struggling to button their favorite pair of jeans (present) or moving
up yet another  belt loop (future). What does that nightmare look
like to their spouse? T o their rivals? How embarrassing!
 
Remember , we can also run the same timeline through someone
else’ s  perspective. Their kid asking why other kids make fun of
them (because they passed on bad food habits) (past), or how their
kids complain now that the other kids’ dads participate at practice
when they don’ t (present), or how their doctor said they might not
walk their daughter down the aisle at her wedding (future). Note:
this is all the bad stuff  they want to avoid. Our next copy elements
would contrast those with the good stuf f that could happen (present
and future) if they buy our thing .
 
W e use both towards good stuf f and away from bad stuf f then
combine it with the past, present, and future of the prospect’ s life
to create powerful  motivators in our copy .
 
 
Putting the What, the Who, and the When together , we answer
WHY they should be interested.
 

If I continued on with the weight loss thing, I might talk about
how:
 
Their spouse  (WHO) will per ceive how fast  (WHA T) they fit into
‘that suit your wife loves that didn’ t fit but does now’ in the futur e
(WHEN). Or , how their kids  (WHO) month after month  (WHEN)
got mor e inter ested in eating healthy and tagging along during
workouts  (WHA T). Or , how they  (WHO) catch a look at
themselves in a r eflection in the mall in a few months (WHEN) and
r ealize ‘stuff actually fits me in this stor e’  (WHA T).
 
 
When we combine:
 
everything we can to get the prospect going towar d  the four
value drivers, while also getting them away fr om  their opposites
 
the many perspectives we can show them gaining status, and  
 

dif ferent timelines for each…
 
…This adds up to why  they should be interested. And now we have
a lot of ways to get them interested! And - the more angles we
cover , the more interested they’ll become.
 
Also - since you asked - the only dif ference between long ads and
short ads is how many angles we have time to cover from the
copywriting framework. Longer ads use more. Shorter ads use
fewer . So add or take away based on the platform, but keep the
callouts (the first few seconds) and CT As (what to do next) the
same.
 
 
Action Steps: Get as many advertising angles with your of fer as
you can with the What-Who-When framework.
 
What:  Know the eight key things about your own product or
service. How it fulfills each element of value, and how it helps
avoid their opposites .

 
Who:  Show how the eight key things about your product or service
can change your pr ospect’ s  status. Then, show how the people they
know  give status to the prospect when they buy your thing or take
status away if they don’ t.
 
When : Get the prospect to see the consequences of buying and not
buying through their past, present, and future. Especially through
their change in status with people they know . This way , we help
them to see the value of their decision (or indecision) at this very
moment.
 
 
I also include a few more ad tips and tricks that have served me
well in the lessons at the end of the chapter . But even if you never
use them, there’ s only one more thing you’ll need to turn these
interested folks into engaged leads…

 
3) CT A - T ell Them What T o Do Next
 
If your ad got them interested, then your audience will have huge
motivation… for a tiny time. T ake advantage. T ell them exactly
what to do next . S-P-E-L-L it out: Click this button. Call this
number . Reply with “YES.” Go to this website. Scan this QR Code
(wink). So many ads still  don’ t do this. Y our audience can only
know what to do if you tell them.
 
Make CT As quick and easy . Easy phone numbers, obvious buttons,
simple websites. For example, a common CT A is to direct the
audience to a website. So make your web address short and
memorable:
 
Instead of…  alexsprivateequityfirm.com/free-book-and-course2782
 
Use.. acquisition.com/training
 
Note: This comes from a guy who spent $370,000 on a single word
domain Acquisition.com . So, I may overvalue easy domains, but I
don’ t think I do. I think everyone else under values them. Just my
two cents.
 


 
Beyond these basics which most still for get, you can also use all
the tactics like ur gency , scarcity , and bonuses from “Step 7” from
the “engage your leads” chapter to make even stronger CT As. They
apply here, and everywhere else you tell your audience to do
something.
 
So we can now pick a platform to advertise on, tar get who we
show our ads to, make the ads they see, and tell them what to do
next. All we have to do now is get their contact information.
 
 
Step #4 “How do I get their info?” → Get Permission T o
Contact Them
After they take the action–Get. Their . Contact. Information .  My
favorite way to get contact information is a simple landing page.
Don’ t overthink it. The simpler your landing page, the easier it is
to test. Focus on the words and the image. Here are my three
favorite templates. Pick one and start testing.
 
 

And make your landing pages match your ads.  People click an ad
because you promised them some benefit. So carry that same look
and language over to your landing page. Make sure what you
promised in your ad is what you deliver . This sounds simple, but a
lot of people for get, and waste money until they remember it. Y ou
don’ t want to end up with some Frankenstein experience where
everything looks dif ferent. Y ou want a continuous experience from
“click to close.”
 
Get more people through more steps . In Robert Cialdini’ s seminal
work, Influence , he shows that people like to think of themselves
as consistent. So, if you remind them of the action they just took
(CT A), and show how taking the next action aligns with it, you’ll
get more people to take the second action (Contact Info). For
example, “Now that you just did A, you need to do B to get the
most of A.” Or  “Doing A makes you a ‘doing A ’ kind of person.
Doing A kind of people, do B.”
 
T o be clear , we aren’ t selling anything. W e are asking if they’re
interested in the stuf f we sell. And if they’re interested, they’ll give
us a way to tell them more about it. And when they do, they
become engaged leads. W oo!
 
Action Step: Build your first landing page. I wasted four years
feeling too scared to make a landing page. When I finally tried, I
finished before lunch. Nowadays there are tons of “drag and drop”
tools to build websites in minutes. And if you’re still worried about
it, freelancers will build a site, probably using those same drag and
drop tools, on the cheap. So just get it done.
 
→ Now , you have engaged leads fr om paid ads!  Hooray! W e did
it!
 
 

Run Paid Ads Part I Conclusion
 
What has to  happen for advertising to work? W ell, we have to
show our ad to the right people. So, we pick the right platform and
tar get the people within that platform that have the highest
percentage of our audience. Once we do that, we have to get them
to notice  our ad. Once they notice it, they have to consume it to get
a reason  to take action now rather than later . W e do that using the
value equation. And demonstrate it in the past, present and future,
from their perspective and the perspectives of the people they
know . And once they have a reason to take action, they have to
have a way to give us permission to contact them.  That action
turns them into an engaged lead . And since those things gotta
happen, they slowly but surely became the three core elements of
every ad I create:
 
1)  Callouts (for them to notice it)
 
2)  V alue Elements (to give them reason to do something)
 
3)  Calls to action (to give them a way to do it)
 
 
Now… only one question remains…how ef ficient are we? Let’ s
talk about money stuf f.
