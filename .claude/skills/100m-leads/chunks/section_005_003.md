“If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far , go
together” - African Pr overb
 
 
June 2021.
 
The new sales dir ector piped up,  “I know we came in under our
goal again, but I don’ t think we need to change anything, we’ll hit
it this quarter .”
 
Eyes darted around the room and looked in every direction but
mine. The silence was long enough for the executive assistant to
mark the topic covered and move on. No wonder we missed our
cold outreach goal for the second quarter in a row… nobody
challenged the failure. What, so now we think the thir d time's a
charm?
 

“W ait.” I said. Now everyone  looked in my direction. “I’d like to
know why we didn’ t hit this two quarters in a row . I know we can
sell–so if we want to make more sales with cold outreach, then we
do  more cold outreach. What’ s the issue?”
 
“W e lose a rep every four weeks.” the sales director said. Aha.
 
“Ok…Why is our churn so high?”.
 
“I was wondering the same thing, but HR says we’re actually
below industry average churn for this position.” He continued,
“But, by the time we hire and onboard one, another churns out.”
 
I saw the HR director nodding in agreement. Getting warmer .
 
“OK, so the issue is hiring.” I said. “So, what’ s the hiring situation
look like?”
 
“W e hire one out of every four candidates HR pushes to us.”
 
“So if they churn out as fast as we hire them, and you only hire one
out of every four , that means you only get like one candidate a
week? ”
 
“Y eah, about that” Almost ther e.
 
“Gotcha” Now I looked at the HR Director , “What’ s the screening
situation look like?”
 

“W e get one qualified candidate per ten screening interviews, give
or take.” She said.
 
“So it takes forty  interviews to get a single, low-skill, frontline
worker?”
 
“I guess so.” Bingo.
 
“Alright, we need to change things up.” I said. “W e're bottlenecked
at the one-on-one screening. Start interviewing in groups and look
for crazies there. Push everyone else with a good work ethic and
basic social skills over to sales. W e can teach the rest. Agreed?”
The team nodded.
 
W ithin six weeks, hiring outpaced churn. Our cold outreach sales
increased in lockstep. By the end of the quarter , cold outreach sales
had doubled, and made up more than half our total sales.
 
The issue wasn’ t our cold outreach method, skills, or of fer at all.
W e just didn’ t have enough people doing  cold outreach.

If you use the methods in this book, you will see more engaged
leads flow into your business. More engaged leads means more
customers. But as you grow , so does your workload. In due time, it
will take more work than any single person can handle. And you
can solve the problem of too much work for one person  by having
mor e people work.  In short, to advertise more, you’ll need more
workers. And this chapter will show you how employees work,
why they make you wealthy , how to get them, and the method I
use to turn them into lead-getters.

 
 
How Employees W ork
 
Lead-getting employees  are people working in your business that
you train to get you leads. They get you leads the exact same way
you got your own leads in the beginning. They can run ads, they
can make and post content, and they can do outreach. They can do
any advertising you train them to do . So more lead-getting
employees means more engaged leads for your business. It also
means less work you  have to do to get the leads. More leads and
less work? Sign me up! But wait… Not so fast…
 
Don't get me wrong–- employees take work . They just take less
time and work than doing everything on your own.  In my
experience, if you trade forty hours of doing for four hours of
managing, you work thirty-six hours less. Brilliant. And the best
part is, you can make that trade over and over . Y ou can swap 200
hours of work per week for twenty hours of management. Then,
you trade the twenty hours of managing for a manager , who costs
you four hours per week to lead. What remains is four hours of
work for 200 hours of lead-getting. Boom.
 
Bottom Line:  Employees make a fully functioning enterprise that
grows without you .
 
 
Why Employees Make Y ou W ealthy
 

For your business to run without you, other people need to run it.
 
Scenario #1 : Imagine you have a business that makes $5,000,000
per year in revenue and $2,000,000 in profit. And, to make that
profit, you have to work around the clock. In this situation, you
basically have a high paying job. But let’ s say you're OK with
working all hours and knowing your business would burn down if
you took a vacation. V acations are for losers anyways (kidding
*cough* sort of…). W e still have another important thing to look
at…
 
Sure, you make a bit of money , but your business isn’ t worth much.
If the business only makes money with you in it, then it’ s a bad
investment for anyone  else. That may not sound like a big deal
right now , but let’ s consider an alternative.
 
Scenario #2 : Y our business makes the same $5,000,000 in revenue
and $2,000,000 in profit. But there’ s one big dif ference: The
business runs  without you. This does two very cool things. One, it
turns what used to be a risky job into a valuable asset. And two, it
makes you much  wealthier . Here’ s how:
 
First, you get your time back, so you can use that time to invest in
your business, buy other businesses, or take your stinkin’
vacations. Second, you become much wealthier because your

business is now worth something to someone else . Y ou turned a
liability  that relied on you into an asset  you can rely on.
 
If you have an asset that makes millions of dollars without you  then
that means somebody else could use it to make millions of dollars
without them . In other words, your business is now a good
investment.  Then investors looking for assets, like Acquisition.com
for instance, would buy some or all of it from you. And your
$2,000,000 in profit per year , especially if it’ s climbing, could
easily be worth $10,000,000+, right now . So your business went
from having almost zer o  value to having $10,000,000 of value. So,
learning how to get other people to do it for you makes a
$10,000,000 dif ference to your net worth. I’d say it’ s worth
learning how to do it.
 
Reminder: Y ou get rich fr om what you make. Y ou become wealthy
fr om what you own . And it took me years to realize this because
not that long ago…
 
 
Everything I Thought I Knew About Employees W as W r ong
 
Have you ever heard…
 
If you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself.
 
No one can do it like I do it.
 
Nobody can r eplace me.
 

I have. I said all that stuf f. I lived all that stuf f. For years, every
time I hired somebody , I would compare what they could to what I
could do. In my head, I felt like it was “me against them.” T o
somehow prove I was the more ‘able’ one. W ith my own team!
And this belief, this way of “leading” people, never made me more
money .
 
For business– “nobody can do it but me” and “if you want
something done right you gotta do it yourself” aren’ t facts…
they’re false. Somebody did similar stuf f before you were around.
And somebody will continue doing some version of it after you’re
gone. In one way or another–everyone is replaceable. It might be
by multiple people, technology , or later in time, but everyone  can
be replaced. My suggestion: replace yourself as soon as you can.
Then, you can make yourself useful somewhere else. Many other
people figured this out. And so can you.
 
In the early days, whenever I started a business, I could do stuf f
better than the people I hired. My entire workforce always ended
up looking like a ragtag group of misfits who could kind of  do one
of the many things I could do. This got me up and running at first,
but I fell into the trap of believing I was better than everyone else.
I would go back and forth between gloating because I was better
than them and complaining because they weren’ t as good as me.
And for whatever reason, it never occurred to me I was the one
who hired and trained them. Who was I kidding?  The reality was
twofold: First, I didn’ t have the skills to train or lead a team
properly . Second, I was too poor , and then (when I had a little
money) too cheap to hire anyone better . In other words, it was my
fault they sucked. Oops.
 
The more I tried to outcompete my employees, the more distracted
I became, and the worse my business got. Sure, at the time, maybe
I could do anything  better than any  of my employees. But… I

couldn’ t do  everything  better than all  my employees. And when I
finally realized this, I started adopting better beliefs about talent:
 
‘If you want it done right, get someone to spend all their time
doing it.’
 
‘If I can do it, someone else can do it better .’
 
‘Everyone is r eplaceable, especially me.’
 
These new beliefs about talent not only made a much healthier
culture in my businesses but also came with very profitable side
ef fects. T rusting my employees to succeed made my  time and
attention far  more valuable. If somebody else can do it, why would
I? If somebody else could train them, why would I? If I could learn
other stuf f to grow the business while my team held the fort down,
it makes way  more sense to do that. So let’ s do that.
 
How T o Get Employee Leads: The Internal Cor e Four
 
Remember the core four? W ell, they work for getting employees
too. Imagine that. By changing the frame from “letting potential
customers know about your stuf f” to “letting potential employees
know about your stuf f” it immediately  turns into something you
already know how to do. But some people also have the opposite
problem–they already know how to get employees just fine but still
struggle to get customers. Employees ar e just other people you let
know about your stuff. So you do the same thing!
 

 
Line up the actions to get employees with the actions to get
customers. It’ s the same stuff!
 
Customers → Employees
 
W arm Outreach→Asking Y our Network
Cold Outreach→ Recruiting
Post Content→Posting Job Openings
Paid Ads→Promoting Job Postings
 
Customer Referrals→Employee Referrals

Af filiates→ Associations, Guilds, Listservs etc.
Agencies→ Staf fing firms etc.
Employees→Employees (unchanged)
 
The ways you get employee leads and their lead getters have
equivalents to the ways you get customer leads and their  lead
getters. So when you need to get new talent, you just advertise to
get it. And when you need more, you do more. And like creating a
reliable process to get customers, you can also create a reliable
process of getting employees. And you’ll need both  to scale.
 
 
How T o Get Employees T o Get Y ou Leads
 
Now you hire someone who costs you money every month. Great.
Let’ s make sure you make it back, and some  ASAP .
 
Note–some people looking for work will already know how to get
leads. Those people are awesome. Y ou can also count on them to
cost more. And if you’re starting out, you may not be able to af ford
them. So, your next best option is to train them. Thankfully , you
have an entire book of lead-getting at your fingertips. So the next
step is training your employees on how you  do those lead-getting
activities. I think about and actually approach training with this
3Ds mental model: document, demonstrate, duplicate.  Here’ s how
it works.
 
Step One - Document .  Y ou make a checklist .  Y ou already know
how to do the thing. Now you just need to write down the steps
exactly as you do it. Y ou can also have other trusted observers
watch you and document what you do. Bonus points if you record
yourself doing the thing multiple ways and in multiple shifts. This
way , you can watch yourself as an observer rather than breaking

your flow by pausing to take notes while you go. Once you’ve got
everything put into the checklist, bust it out on your next work
block and only  follow those steps. Can you do an A+ job only
following your  directions exactly ? If you can, you have the first
draft  of your checklist for the job.
 
Step T wo - Demonstrate : Y ou do it in fr ont of them .  Just like your
parents taught you how to tie your shoes. Y ou sit down and walk
them through the checklist step by step. This may take a while
depending on how many steps it takes to complete the thing. If
they stop you, or slow you down to understand something, adjust
your checklist for that. Now you have the second draft  ready for
them to try .
 
Step Thr ee - Duplicate : They do it in fr ont of you . Now it’ s their
turn. They follow the same checklist you followed. Except this
time, they’re the one doing, and you’re the one observing. W e just
want them to duplicate  what we did. So if the checklist is right, the
outcome will be the same. And if the checklist is of f–you’ll find
out fast! Fix your checklist until it’ s right. Then, have them follow
it until they get it right. And once they nail it , you now have a
bonafide lead-getter on your payroll. Congratulations!
 
 
After you train your first few employees this way , you’ll have
worked out the kinks for that job and it’ s pretty smooth sailing

from there. At least the training part anyways. Think about it this
way , if you vanished tomorrow , could a stranger get the results you
get if they only followed your checklist? That’ s the level of clarity
to shoot for .
 
Some helpful notes on training:
 
A helpful way to look at this training style is: If they get it wr ong
or get confused then we got it wr ong or made it confusing.  If we
have to explain what a step means then the step is too
complicated. Or , more likely , we tried to put multiple steps into
one.
 
If they only appear to “get it” after a longish explanation or
multiple demonstrations then, again, we’ve got some work to do.
Business owners that ignore this run into chronic training
problems. And, word to the wise, you can probably force an
inferior checklist to work, but this turns into a nightmar e  when
somebody else takes over your training for you.
 
There is a dif ference between competence and performance. In
other words, they can know exactly what to do and not be that
good at it yet . If that’ s the case, then your instructions are fine
and they just need practice.  Using an analogy from the fitness
world–think “slow then smooth then fast.” Y ou don’ t need to
change anything, they just need more reps.
 
Focus on your employee’ s ability to follow dir ections mor e than
whether they get the right r esult.  This is super important because
if you train your employees to follow directions then… they will
follow directions. And, if they follow directions and get the
wrong result… then you know it’ s the dir ections . That’ s good.
Y ou have a lot more control over that.
 

Everytime they do a step successfully– let them know they did it
right . And if they respond to praise, praise them! And if they
goof, that’ s OK too. That’ s what training is for . Don’ t take over
for them when they mess up–simply pause, take a step back, and
let them try it again. Fast feedback cycles to get people to learn
faster .
 
If they follow your directions exactly  and get the wrong result–
still praise them for following the directions. Praise them, then
make the corrections to your checklist on the spot.
 
A void punishment or penalties of any type for doing stuf f wrong
during training. As a rule of thumb–reward the good stuf f you
want them to do more of and they'll do more of it. Learning a
new skill is punishing enough, we don't need to add to it.
 
It’ s hard to fix multiple things when you've never done
something befor e . Give feedback one step at a time. Give one
piece of feedback at a time. Practice until they get it right. Then,
move to the next step.
 
Whenever there is a major dip from normal performance, retrain
the team. They stopped doing an important step in the process
(often because they didn’ t know it was important). Once you
figure out the step, reward people for following it going forward.
 
 
How to Calculate Returns Fr om Lead-Getting Employees
 
Excluding the cost of running paid ads,  the cost of advertising
(outreach, content, etc.) with employees is almost entirely based on
the amount of money you pay them to do it. W e simplify this by
just comparing how much money we spend on payroll to how
much money the engaged leads they get bring in:

 
●    T otal Payroll / T otal Engaged Leads = Cost per engaged lead.
 
○    Ex: $100,000 / 1000 leads = $100 per engaged lead
 
●    If one out of ten of the engaged leads become customers then
our CAC is $1000
 
○    ($100 per engaged lead) x (10 engaged leads per
customer) = $1000 CAC
 
●    If each customer has an L TGP of $4000 then you have an
L TGP : CAC of 4:1
 
○    ($4000 L TGP) / ($1000 CAC) = 4:1
 
For example: at the time of this writing, I get about 30,000
engaged leads per month at Acquistion.com. I run no paid ads, and
do no outreach. But the team responsible for creating the content
that generates that interest is about $100,000 per month. This
means, it costs me roughly $3.33 per engaged lead ($100,000 /
30,000 leads) in payroll to generate them. W e make much more
than $3.33 per lead, so we’re profitable. Y ou can apply the same
math to whatever advertising method you use.
 
 
How T o Know Which Employees to Focus On T o Maximize
Returns
 
Like we learned in Run Paid Ads Part II–if your cost to get a
customer is within 3x industry average then you’re doing good
enough . From there, you focus on bumping up your L TGP .
 

If your CAC is more than 3x industry average then you have a
sales problem or an advertising problem. W e diagnose this with a
single question:
 
Do my engaged leads have the pr oblem I solve and the money to
spend?
 
If no, then they’re not qualified–that’ s an advertising problem.
 
If yes, then they’re qualified and:
 
They’re buying but you don’ t have enough of them–
advertising problem.
 
They’re qualified but not buying–sales problem.
 
Don’ t fire your sales guy if you’ve got advertising problems. And
equally , don’ t fire your advertising employees if you’ve got a sales
problem. That little question can help you identify which
employees to focus on.
 
But fundamentally , you just need to figure out all your  costs of
getting a customer put together . And as long as they’re at least one-
third of the profit you make over the lifetime, you’re in good
shape.
 
 
Conclusion
 
The goal of this chapter was to shift your perspective . It's your job
to advertise and sell the vision of your company . Y ou advertise it

publicly and  privately to employees and  customers alike. That’ s
the job. And once you get good at it, you become unstoppable.
 
I say this because I believe anyone can be taught to do "ground
level" jobs for any business– advertising or otherwise. So who you
pick is not as important as how you train the ones you do.
 
Like I've said throughout the book and will say again here–it
doesn't take a genius to advertise. I'd even say it hurts. W e’ve got
plenty more iron-wills than brainiacs anyways. Remember , this
isn’ t about brains, it's about guts. And although some people might
be born geniuses, nobody  is born with an iron will (after all, we all
come out crybabies). All this to say having guts is a skill.  And that
means anyone  can have the guts if they learn how .  So if you have
an iron-will, and as an entrepreneur you probably do, it won’ t take
long for you to figure out that you got it from your life
experiences. Y ou can pass those experiences on as lessons to
anyone who cares enough to listen. Then, they can stand on your
shoulders and have a better chance at succeeding in life.
 
And - you can’ t really know anything anyway until you train them
well and give them a fighting chance to succeed out in the field.
Plus, for low level jobs, you'll never have a shortage of labor . Get
picky when you have to make massive investments in hyper -
specific-multiple-six-figure-C-suite employees. Aka - ‘fancy
employees.’
 
I find at this current stage, it's actually a better use of time, to hire
and train anyone willing . Then, when  you find winners, and with
this method you will: treat them well, don’ t burn them out, and
give them what they deserve.
 
In the land of overflowing leads, you’ll need allies. Employees are
among the most powerful of these allies. W e talked about: how

they make you wealthy , how they work, how getting them works,
how to get them, how to get them getting you leads, how to keep
them getting you leads, and how to know you’re doing a good job.
And once you’ve built a system for getting people who get you
leads (doing the core four on your behalf), you just need to do
more.
 
 
 
The Next Lead Getter…
 
The next stop on our advertising journey leads us to agencies. Y es,
you can pay people to shortcut your path. I have paid zillions of
dollars to agencies and I believe I’ve finally *cracked* the code on
how to create a win for all parties. For us, so we’re not dependent
on them forever . For them, so they can make more profit and
provide more value to their customers. They’ve been key to many
breakthroughs I’ve had, so you won’ t want to skip this next one…
