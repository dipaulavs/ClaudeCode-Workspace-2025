How long does this take? For business owners who know what to
do–anywhere from five to ten years. Building something great,
even if you know exactly what to do, takes time. And so many like
to trumpet “overnight success,” but looking behind the curtain tells
a dif ferent story . It took my wife and I mor e than ten years of our
best effort, to cross the first $100M in net worth. So the bigger
your goals, the longer your time horizons need to be. Y ou want to
play games where if you wait, you win.
 
 

 


A  D e c a d e  i n  a  P a g e
“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication” - Leonar do Da V inci
 
W e’ve covered a lot. And I think or ganizing what we learned into
one place helps it sink in. So I made this “back of the napkin” list
of what we’ve covered and why .
 
1)  How to define a lead from this point forward. Now you know
what you’re after: engaged leads, not just leads.
 
2)  How to turn leads into engaged leads with an of fer or lead
magnet. And, how to make them. 
 
3)  The Cor e Four  - the only four ways we can let people know
about the stuf f we sell. 
 
a)   How to reach out to people who know us: ask them if
they know anybody 
 
b)  How to post publicly: hook, r etain, r ewar d. Give until
they ask.
 
c)   How to reach out to strangers: lists, personalization, big
fast value, volume
 
d)  How to run paid ads to strangers: tar geting, callouts,
What-Who-Whens, CT As, client financed acquisition
 
4)  Maximizing the Core Four:  Mor e Better  New
 

a)   What keeps us from doing what I’m currently doing at
ten times the volume? Then solving for that.
 
b)  Finding the constraint in our advertising. Then testing
until it frees the constraint. Then doing mor e  until it gets
constrained again. 
 
5)  The Four Lead Getters: Customers, Employees, Agencies, and
Affiliates
 
a)   How to get customers to refer other customers 
 
b)  How to get employees to scale your advertising without
you
 
c)   How to get an agency to teach you new skills
 
d)  How to get af filiates launched and integrated
 
6)  When advertising in the real world: The Rule of 100 and Open to
Goal
 
a)   The five step one-page advertising plan to get more
leads today .
 
7)  The seven levels of advertisers and the $100M leads  machine in
action.
 
As I promised in the beginning, the result of these bullets is more,
better , cheaper , reliable engaged leads. I hope this book provides
you utility . I hope as a result of reading this you know how to get
more leads than you currently are. And I hope I unmasked the
mystery behind lead getting.

 
Also, since you are one of the few who actually finish what you
start, I want to leave you with a parting gift: a fable that has gotten
me through my hardest times.
 
 
The Many Sided Die
 
 
Imagine you and a friend play a dice-rolling game. Y ou are each
given one die. One of the die has 20 sides. The other has 200. On
each die, only one side is green. And the rest, are red.
 
The point of the game is simple: Roll gr een as many times as you
can.
 
The rules of the game are as follows:
 
Y ou can’ t see how many sides you have. Y ou can only see if you
r oll r ed or gr een.
 
If you r oll gr een–One of your r ed sides turns gr een, and you get
to r oll again. 
 

If you r oll r ed–Nothing happens, and you get to r oll again.
 
The game ends when you stop r olling. And if you stop r olling,
you lose. 
 
What do you do?
 
Y ou r oll.  When you roll red, you pick up the die and roll again.
When others roll green, you pick up your die and roll again. When
you roll green, you pick up the die and roll again. Y ou keep telling
yourself one thing. “The more I roll, the more greens I get.” At
first, you roll green once in a while. But as more red sides turn
green, the greens happen more. W ith enough rolls, hitting green
becomes the rule rather than the exception.
 
What does your friend do?
 
He rolls a few times and hits red each time. He sees you roll a
green and complains that you must  have a die with fewer sides. He
reasons, it’ s the only  way you could have rolled green before him.
And although you did, you also rolled many more times. So which
is it?
 
In either case, he rolls a few more times in frustration and hits a
green. But then he complains about how long it took. He’ s spent
more time watching you and complaining than actually playing.
Meanwhile, you’ve hit your green streak. It’ s so much easier for
you , he tells himself.  Y ou get gr eens every time!  This game is
rigged, so what’ s the point? He quits.
 
***
 

So who got the die with 20 sides? Who got the die with 200 sides?
If you get the game then you see, once you roll enough times, the
die you’r e given doesn’ t matter .
 
Die with fewer sides might roll green sooner .
 
Die with more sides might roll green later .
 
But, a die with a green side always  has a chance of rolling
green… if you r oll it.
 
Every die hits its green streak when rolled enough times.
 
All of us get a many-sided die. And looking at the other players,
you have no idea if it’ s their 100th roll or their 100,000th. Y ou
don't know how “good” other players are when they start, you can
only see how well they do now . But, if you understand the game,
you also know it doesn’ t matter .
 
A few begin playing early . Others begin much later . The rest sit on
the sidelines complaining about how lucky the players are. I guess
so, but they’re luckier because they play . And when they hit red,
which they do, they didn’ t quit. They rolled again.
 
Learning to advertise is a lot like the game of the many sided die.
Y ou do not know if it will work until you try . And when you start
advertising, you will probably hit red on your first rolls. But if you
try enough times you will hit gr een.  And when  it works, you have a
better chance of getting it to work again. The more you do it, the
easier it gets. Y ou begin to understand the game. No matter how
many players there are or the number of sides on the die you’re
given, you start to see the only two guarantees:
 

1) The more times you roll, the better you get.
 
2) If you quit, you lose
 
 
 
So here’ s my final promise:
 
Y ou cannot lose if you do not quit.
