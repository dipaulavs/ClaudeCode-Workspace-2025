---

#### Cause 2: Lead Magnet Isn't Compelling

**Diagnosis**:
- Opt-in rate < 15% (cold traffic)
- Opt-in rate < 30% (warm traffic)
- People click but don't convert
- High bounce rate on landing page

**Solution**:

✓ **Immediate Action**:
Test new lead magnet names:

- Show what's inside (screenshots, preview)
- Add testimonials from people who used it
- Reduce friction (no credit card, instant access)

✓ **Long-Term**:
Create multiple lead magnets:
- Software version (calculator/tool)
- Information version (guide/checklist)
- Service version (audit/assessment)
- Rotate and test which performs best

**Expected Results**:
- Week 1: 20-50% increase in opt-ins
- Month 1: Double lead volume same traffic
- Quarter 1: Optimized lead magnet portfolio

---

#### Cause 3: Audience Doesn't Know You Exist

**Diagnosis**:

- Low website traffic
- Few people engaging with content
- Brand searches near zero

**Solution**:

✓ **Immediate Action**:
Leverage existing networks:
- Post on LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram TODAY
- Share lead magnet in relevant groups (value-first)
- DM 50 people you already know
- Ask customers to share your content

✓ **Short-Term**:
Build awareness systematically:
- Post daily for 90 days straight (no excuses)

✓ **Long-Term**:
Become omnipresent:

**Expected Results**:

## PROBLEM #2: Lead Quality Is Poor

### Symptoms
- Leads don't have money to buy
- Wrong audience (not your ICP)
- Tire-kickers and time-wasters
- Low conversion rate lead → customer

### Root Causes & Solutions

#### Cause 1: Targeting Is Too Broad

**Diagnosis**:
- Lead magnet appeals to everyone
- Ad targeting is general ("all business owners")
- Content is generic, not niche-specific
- Attracting curiosity seekers, not buyers

**Solution**:

✓ **Immediate Action**:
Narrow your positioning:
- OLD: "I help people lose weight"
- NEW: "I help busy executives lose 20lbs in 90 days"
- Rewrite lead magnet for specific avatar
- Update ad targeting to exact criteria

✓ **Short-Term**:
Qualify harder upfront:
- Add qualifying questions to opt-in form:
  - "What's your current revenue?" (B2B)
  - "What's your budget?" (Services)
  - "Are you ready to start in next 30 days?"
- Create "disqualifier" content:
  - "This is NOT for you if..."
  - Repels wrong people, attracts right ones

✓ **Long-Term**:
Build ICP-specific assets:
- Case studies of ideal customers only
- Content that speaks to specific pains
- Messaging that filters automatically
- Industry/niche-specific lead magnets

**Expected Results**:
- Week 1: Fewer but better leads
- Month 1: Higher conversion rates
- Quarter 1: Predictable customer profile

---

#### Cause 2: Lead Magnet Attracts Freebie Seekers

**Diagnosis**:
- High opt-ins, low sales
- People ghost after getting free stuff
- "Just browsing" responses
- No intent to buy visible

**Solution**:

✓ **Immediate Action**:
Change lead magnet strategy:
- STOP: "Free 30-day trial" or "Free consultation"
- START: "Free [Thing] + $1 shipping" or "Apply to work with us"
- Even tiny commitment filters serious people

✓ **Short-Term**:
Add friction strategically:
- Application form before free offer
- Survey to "customize" their experience
- Phone number required (signals seriousness)
- "Why do you want this?" question

✓ **Long-Term**:
Nurture sequence that qualifies:
- Email 1: Deliver lead magnet
- Email 2: Teach something advanced
- Email 3: Case study with investment mentioned
- Email 4: Share your process and pricing
- Email 5: Direct offer with qualification
- Freebie seekers drop off, buyers stay engaged

**Expected Results**:
- Week 1: Lower opt-ins, higher intent
- Month 1: Better lead-to-sale conversion
- Quarter 1: Qualified pipeline only

---

## PROBLEM #3: Leads Don't Convert to Customers

### Symptoms
- Lots of leads, few sales
- People ghost after initial interest
- Long sales cycles going nowhere
- High "thinking about it" responses

### Root Causes & Solutions

#### Cause 1: No Follow-Up System

**Diagnosis**:
- Following up 0-2 times only
- No structured sequence
- Waiting for leads to come back
- "Don't want to be pushy" mentality

**Solution**:

✓ **Immediate Action**:
Implement 7-touch follow-up:
- Touch 1: Immediate (lead magnet delivery)
- Touch 2: Day 1 (check-in, value add)
- Touch 3: Day 3 (case study)
- Touch 4: Day 7 (different angle)
- Touch 5: Day 10 (objection handler)
- Touch 6: Day 14 (scarcity/urgency)
- Touch 7: Day 21 (final breakup message)

✓ **Short-Term**:
Automate the sequence:
- Email automation software
- CRM with reminders
- Templates for consistency
- Track response rates per touch

✓ **Long-Term**:
Multi-channel follow-up:
- Email + SMS + Phone + DM
- Video messages for warmth
- Personalized based on behavior
- Reactivation campaigns for old leads

**Expected Results**:
- Week 1: Immediate conversion bump
- Month 1: 30-50% more conversions
- Quarter 1: Systematic pipeline management

**Reality Check**: Most sales happen after 5+ touches. Most people give up after 1-2. Don't be most people.

---

#### Cause 2: Value Equation Is Weak

**Diagnosis**:
- Objections about price, time, effort
- "Let me think about it" responses
- Comparison shopping
- No urgency to buy now

**Solution**:

✓ **Immediate Action**:
Strengthen each element:

**Increase Dream Outcome**:

- Use bigger, bolder promises (that you can deliver)
- Show best-case scenarios

**Increase Perceived Likelihood**:

- Less time required
- Keep doing what they love

✓ **Short-Term**:
Test new messaging:
- Rewrite sales page with value equation
- Update discovery call script
- New ad creative emphasizing value
- A/B test different angles

✓ **Long-Term**:
Actually improve the offer:
- Add more value (bonuses, support)
- Remove friction points
- Faster results (if possible)
- Better guarantees

**Expected Results**:
- Week 1: Messaging improvements
- Month 1: 20-40% conversion increase
- Quarter 1: Market-leading offer

## PROBLEM #4: Cost Per Lead Is Too High

### Symptoms
- Spending more on ads than revenue generated
- CAC > LTV
- Unprofitable campaigns
- Can't scale without losing money

### Root Causes & Solutions

#### Cause 1: Poor Ad Performance

**Diagnosis**:
- Low CTR (< 1% for most platforms)
- High CPM (cost per 1000 impressions)
- Low conversion rate on landing page
- Wrong audience targeting

**Solution**:

✓ **Immediate Action**:
Test new hooks (90% of your problem):
- Create 10 different hooks
- Run for 24-48 hours each
- Kill bottom 50%
- Scale top 20%

Hook Testing Framework:
- Pain/Problem hooks
- Desire/Dream hooks
- Curiosity hooks
- Social proof hooks
- Contrarian hooks

✓ **Short-Term**:
Optimize the funnel:
- Landing page speed (< 3 seconds)
- Mobile optimization
- Headline matches ad
- Reduce form fields
- Add trust signals

✓ **Long-Term**:
Creative testing system:
- New creative every week
- Test format variations (video vs image)
- UGC vs professional content
- Different angles on same offer
- Seasonal and timely content

**Expected Results**:
- Week 1: 30-50% CTR improvement
- Month 1: 50% lower CPL
- Quarter 1: Profitable scaling

---

#### Cause 2: Economics Don't Support Scale

**Diagnosis**:
- Margins too thin
- CAC approaching or exceeding LTV
- Unit economics broken
- Can't raise prices or increase LTV

**Solution**:

✓ **Immediate Action**:
Fix the math:

**Option 1: Increase Prices**
- Test 20-30% price increase
- Better positioning (not more volume)
- Qualify harder (premium buyers)

**Option 2: Increase LTV**
- Upsells and cross-sells
- Recurring revenue model
- Longer retention
- Higher-ticket backend offers

**Option 3: Decrease Costs**
- Optimize ads (hooks, creative)
- Better targeting
- Improve conversion rate
- Efficient operations

✓ **Unit Economics Formula**:
```
LTV (Lifetime Value) > CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) × 3

Minimum acceptable: LTV:CAC = 3:1
Ideal: LTV:CAC = 5:1 or higher
```

Calculate yours:
- LTV = Avg order value × # of purchases × gross margin %
- CAC = Total marketing spend ÷ New customers

Fix whichever is broken.

**Expected Results**:
- Week 1: Clear picture of economics
- Month 1: Profitable unit economics
- Quarter 1: Confident scaling
