I promise to do my best to give you the highest possible return on it. This book delivers. The world needs more entrepreneurs. It needs more fighters. It needs more magic.

Period. As a result, your potential customers are ignorant of your existence. How sad! This means less money flows your way . So now that you know you have a problem, unless you hate helping people and making money , you kinda have to solve it. How this book solves it: T o make more money , you’ve gotta grow your business.

This book will solve your “not getting enough leads” problem for good. In a nutshell: I will show you how to get strangers to want  to buy your stuf f. What’ s In It For Me? --- PÁGINA 33 --- In one word: trust . I give this book and the course that comes with it for free (or at cost) in hopes of earning your trust.

### The Hormozi Advertising Equation

**Advertising = Making Known**

If more people know about what you sell → You sell more stuff → You make more money

### The Growth Formula

Business Growth = Get More Customers + Make Them Worth More

**Leads = The first step to getting more customers**

---

## 2. THE LEAD GENERATION FORMULA

### Core Formula

**Leads = Volume × Conversion**

- **Volume**: Number of people who see your offer (Traffic)
- **Conversion**: % who respond to your offer (Quality of offer + presentation)

### The Four Ways to Get More Leads

1. Increase Traffic (more people see it)
2. Improve Conversion (better offer/presentation)
3. Do both (#1 and #2)
4. Do it more times (frequency)

---

## 3. VALUE EQUATION FRAMEWORK

### The Four Variables of Value

Value increases when you maximize the first two and minimize the last two:

**1. DREAM OUTCOME** ↑
- What they want to happen
- The way they want it to happen
- The best possible results your product can deliver

**2. PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD OF ACHIEVEMENT** ↑
- How likely they think it is to work for them
- Boosted by: results, reviews, awards, endorsements, certifications, guarantees
- Social proof from people like them

**3. TIME DELAY** ↓
- How long until they get results
- Describe: how fast people START getting results
- How often they get results when they start
- How long to get best possible results

**4. EFFORT & SACRIFICE** ↓
- Bad stuff they endure to get results
- Good stuff they give up to get results
- Show what they can KEEP doing and still get results
- Show bad stuff they can AVOID and still get results

### Value Equation in Practice

**Ideal Offer Formula:**
"I help [ideal customer] get [dream outcome] in [time period] without [effort/sacrifice] and [proof]"

---

## 4. LEAD MAGNETS MASTERY

### What is a Lead Magnet?

A **Lead Magnet** is:
- A complete solution to a narrow problem
- Lower-cost or FREE offer
- Shows interest in your stuff
- Reveals another problem solved by your CORE OFFER

**Think:** Salty pretzels at a bar
- Solves hunger (narrow problem)
- Reveals thirst (solved by paid drink)
- Drink revenue > cost of pretzels

### The 7 Steps to Creating Effective Lead Magnets

**Step 1: Pick the Problem & Who**
- Choose a NARROW, meaningful problem
- Make sure your core offer solves the NEXT problem that appears
- Use the Problem-Solution Cycle

**Step 2: Pick Your Solution Type**

Three types of lead magnet solutions:

1. **REVEAL PROBLEMS** (Diagnosis)
   - Make them aware of problems they don't know about
   - Works when problems get worse over time
   - Examples: Speed tests, audits, assessments, inspections

2. **SAMPLES & TRIALS**
   - Full but brief access to core offer
   - Limited uses, time, or both
   - Best for recurring solutions to recurring problems
   - Examples: Free trials, samples, limited access

3. **ONE STEP OF MULTI-STEP PROCESS**
   - Give one valuable step free
   - Rest comes when they buy
   - Best for complex problems
   - Examples: First coat free, starter course, diagnostic session

**Step 3: Pick Delivery Method**

Four ways to deliver lead magnets:

1. **SOFTWARE**: Tools, calculators, spreadsheets, dashboards
2. **INFORMATION**: Courses, guides, interviews, tips, workshops
3. **SERVICES**: Free work, audits, assessments, consultations
4. **PHYSICAL PRODUCTS**: Books, samples, tools, gifts

**Pro Tip:** Create multiple versions (3 types × 4 delivery methods = 12 possible lead magnets)

**Step 4: Test the Name**

Test in this order:
1. **Headline** (most important - test first)
2. **Image**
3. **Subheadline**

Testing process:
- Run polls with your audience
- Post on platforms and ask for votes
- Message people directly
- Small sample sizes give directional insights

**Step 5: Make It Easy to Consume**

Reduce effort = More people consume = Better results

- Software: Accessible on phones, computers, multiple formats
- Information: Shorter is better, video > audio > text for ease
- Services: Make scheduling/access seamless
- Physical: Fast shipping, easy unboxing, clear instructions

**Step 6: Make It DARN GOOD**

Your lead magnet should be SO GOOD you could charge for it

Quality signals trust → Trust leads to sales

**Step 7: Make It Easy to Ask for More**

Clear path to core offer:
- Simple CTA at the end
- Show the next logical step
- Make it feel natural, not pushy
