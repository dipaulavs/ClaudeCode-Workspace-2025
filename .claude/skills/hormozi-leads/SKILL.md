# Hormozi Leads - $100M Leads Framework

Apply Alex Hormozi's complete methodology to transform strangers into buyers using the Core Four methods and Lead Getters amplification.

## When This Skill Auto-Invokes

**Content Creation Requests:**
- Hooks, headlines, CTAs, angles, body copy
- Social media captions (Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn)
- Ad copy, landing pages, sales pages
- SEO descriptions, meta descriptions

**Lead Generation Strategy:**
- Lead magnets, outreach campaigns (warm/cold)
- Paid ads structure, organic content strategy
- Referral systems, affiliate programs

**IMPORTANT:** Even for simple requests like "create a headline," auto-invoke this skill and gather context before generating.

## Core Workflow

### Part 1: Content Creation (Hooks, Headlines, Copy)

When user requests any content element, follow this workflow:

#### Step 1: Gather Context

Collect before generating anything:
- Product/service/offer being promoted
- Target avatar (ideal customer)
- Problem being solved
- Result/transformation promised
- Destination platform (YouTube, Instagram, Ads, etc)

#### Step 2: Generate Magnetic Hooks

Apply 2-3 of the 7 Hook Elements for maximum impact:

1. **RECENCY** - "Yesterday I discovered...", "Just tested..."
2. **RELEVANCY** - "If you're [specific persona]...", "For those who [situation]..."
3. **CELEBRITY** - "How [authority] achieved...", "Stolen from [expert]..."
4. **PROXIMITY** - "In your business...", "In your city..."
5. **CONFLICT** - "Why [common belief] is wrong", "[A] vs [B]"
6. **UNUSUAL** - "I don't [expected action]...", "Sounds crazy but..."
7. **ONGOING** - "Testing this now...", "Day 7 of 30 doing..."

**Reference:** See [references/hooks-biblioteca.md](references/hooks-biblioteca.md) for 50+ validated hooks.

**Combination Strategy:** Recency + Unusual + Relevancy = maximum attention capture.

#### Step 3: Create Headlines Using 30 Frameworks

Select from 30 headline frameworks organized in 13 categories:
- Transformation (Before→After, Number+Result, Specific Timeline)
- Revelation/Secret (Hidden Secret, Contrary Insight, Authorized Theft)
- Errors/Warnings (Costly Mistake, Multiple Errors, Urgent Alert)
- Method/System (Named System, Step-by-Step, Blueprint)
- Plus 9 more categories...

**Master Formula:**
[Number] [Form/Method] for [Specific Avatar] to achieve [Desired Result] in [Timeline] without [Pain/Effort]

**Reference:** See [references/headlines-frameworks.md](references/headlines-frameworks.md) for complete framework library.

**Output:** Generate 10-15 headlines using varied frameworks for user selection.

#### Step 4: Structure Content with Retention Mechanisms

Choose retention mechanism based on content type:
- **Lists** - "X ways to...", "X mistakes that..."
- **Steps** - "Step-by-step", "Complete guide"
- **Stories** - Journey, transformation, real case

**Reference:** See [references/retain-formulas.md](references/retain-formulas.md) for complete structures.

#### Step 5: Apply Value Equation to Every Element

Maximize perceived value using the 4-element formula:

```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood)
        ÷ (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)
```

**Increase:** Dream Outcome (better result) + Perceived Likelihood (proof it works)
**Decrease:** Time Delay (fast results) + Effort & Sacrifice (no pain)

**Reference:** See [references/equacao-valor.md](references/equacao-valor.md) for framework details.

#### Step 6: Create Persuasive CTAs

Select CTA level matching value provided (Give:Ask ratio):
- **Level 1:** Soft (Save, Follow, Share)
- **Level 2:** Engagement (Comment, Tag, DM keyword)
- **Level 3:** Lead Magnet (Link in bio, Free download)
- **Level 4:** Qualification (Fill form, Book call)
- **Level 5:** Direct Sale (Buy now, Limited spots)

**Reference:** See [references/ctas-persuasivos.md](references/ctas-persuasivos.md) for 30 CTA templates.

#### Step 7: Special Format - Instagram Carousels (6-10 slides)

Structure:
- **Slide 1:** Hook (2-3 elements + headline framework)
- **Slides 2-8:** Retain & Reward (list/steps/story)
- **Slide 9:** Recap + Transition
- **Slide 10:** Persuasive CTA

**Reference:** See [references/carrosseis-instagram.md](references/carrosseis-instagram.md) for complete structure.

#### Step 8: Deliver Complete Package

Generate:
- Headlines (10-15 options with varied frameworks)
- Platform-specific descriptions (YouTube: Headline + Timestamps + Links + CTA + Hashtags)
- Body copy (Hook → Retain → Reward)
- CTAs (Ask proportional to Give)
- Strategic hashtags

### Part 2: Lead Generation Strategy (Core Four + Lead Getters)

When user requests lead generation strategy, follow this roadmap:

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Engaged Leads)

1. Create irresistible offer (Grand Slam Offer) as base
2. Develop lead magnet using 4-step framework
3. Define metrics: CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), LTGP (Lifetime Gross Profit), LTGP:CAC ratio

#### Phase 2: Core Four Methods (Execute in Parallel)

**1. Warm Outreach** (100 contacts/day)
- Extract complete contact list (phone, email, social media)
- Personalize messages using ACA framework (Acknowledge, Compliment, Ask)
- Follow-up 3x before stopping

**2. Post Free Content** (1+ post/day)
- Hook: Capture attention (Headlines + Topics: Far Past, Recent Past, Present, Trending, Manufactured)
- Retain: Keep attention (storytelling, value delivery)
- Reward: Satisfy consumption reason
- Give:Ask Ratio appropriate for each platform

**3. Cold Outreach** (Maximum automated volume)
- Build lists (scraping + purchase + manual)
- Personalize + Big Fast Value
- Automate delivery and distribution
- Strategic follow-up (multiple channels)

**4. Run Paid Ads**
- Structure: Call Out → Retain → Reward → CTA
- Test: Headlines, Images, Audiences
- Scale: More, Better, New

#### Phase 3: Lead Getters (Exponential Amplification)

1. **Customer Referrals:** 6 Ways to Give Value + 7 Ways to Ask
2. **Employees:** Hire and train to execute Core Four
3. **Agencies:** Outsource execution while maintaining strategy
4. **Affiliates/Partners:** Create scalable win-win programs

**Reference:** See [references/REFERENCE.md](references/REFERENCE.md) for complete methodology.

## Quick Decision Framework

```
No leads → Warm Outreach (NOW)
<1000 leads → Warm Outreach + Content
>1000 leads → Add Cold Outreach
Has budget → Add Paid Ads
Has traction → Implement Lead Getters
```

## Success Metrics

Track these KPIs:
- Decreasing CAC
- LTGP:CAC ratio >3:1 (ideally >4:1)
- Referrals > Churn (organic growth)
- Growing engaged leads volume
- Stable or increasing conversion rate

## Auto-Correction System

This skill includes automatic error correction to learn from mistakes and prevent recurrence.

### When Errors Occur

```
Error detected
↓
1. Fix SKILL.md: python3 scripts/update_skill.py <old_text> <new_text>
2. Log learning: python3 scripts/log_learning.py <error> <fix> [line]
3. Error prevented in future executions
```

### Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Fix error in SKILL.md
python3 scripts/update_skill.py \
    'old incorrect instruction' \
    'new correct instruction'

# 2. Log the learning
python3 scripts/log_learning.py \
    "Description of what went wrong" \
    "Description of fix applied" \
    "SKILL.md:123"
```

**Result:** SKILL.md updated automatically + entry added to LEARNINGS.md with timestamp.
