# Marketing Writer - Troubleshooting

## Common Problems & Solutions

---

## Problem 1: Copy Sounds Generic/Corporate

### Symptoms
- "Leverage our cutting-edge platform"
- "World-class solutions"
- "Synergize your workflow"
- Sounds like every other company
- No personality

### Root Cause
- Using buzzwords and jargon
- Writing for C-level, not actual users
- Trying to sound "professional"
- Not understanding target audience

### Solution

**The Jargon Detector Test:**

Read your copy out loud. Would you say this to a friend at coffee? If no, rewrite.

```markdown
❌ BEFORE (corporate jargon):
"Our revolutionary platform leverages cutting-edge AI technology to facilitate streamlined workflow optimization and deliver best-in-class results for forward-thinking enterprises."

✅ AFTER (conversational):
"Turn messy data into clear insights in minutes. Our AI reads your spreadsheets and tells you what actually matters."
```

**Buzzword Replacements:**

| Buzzword | Plain English |
|----------|---------------|
| Leverage → Use |
| Facilitate → Help |
| Utilize → Use |
| Synergy → Working together |
| Revolutionary → Different |
| Cutting-edge → New |
| Best-in-class → Better than alternatives |
| Enterprise-grade → Reliable |
| Innovative → New approach |
| Solution → Tool/Product |

**Quick fixes:**
1. Replace passive voice with active: "Data can be exported" → "Export your data"
2. Remove adjectives: "incredibly powerful" → "powerful" or remove entirely
3. Use "you" more than "we": Focus on user, not company
4. Write like you talk: Read out loud, fix awkward phrases

## Problem 2: No Clear Value Proposition

### Symptoms
- Can't explain product in one sentence
- Multiple vague benefits
- "It's like X but for Y"
- Users don't understand what it does

### Root Cause
- Trying to appeal to everyone
- Feature-focused instead of benefit-focused
- Fear of being too specific
- No clear differentiation

### Solution

**The Elevator Pitch Formula:**

```
[Product] helps [specific audience] [accomplish outcome] by [unique approach].
```

**Example extraction process:**

```markdown
User: "It's a platform for managing social media."

You: "Let's get specific:

Q: Who specifically? (not "businesses" or "marketers")
A: "Solo content creators who post on Twitter and LinkedIn"

Q: What outcome do they want?
A: "Schedule posts in advance so they don't have to post manually every day"

Q: Why existing tools don't work?
A: "Too expensive ($50/mo for Buffer) and too complex"

Q: What's different about your approach?
A: "Free tier, dead simple (3 clicks to schedule), AI suggests posting times"

FINAL VALUE PROP:
"BufferLite helps solo creators schedule Twitter and LinkedIn posts for free. AI suggests the best times to post. No $50/mo plans, no complex analytics."
```

**The "So What?" Test:**

Keep asking "so what?" until you hit the real benefit:

```
Feature: "Real-time sync"
→ So what? "Your data updates instantly"
→ So what? "Your team sees changes without refreshing"
→ So what? "No more asking 'is this the latest version?'"
→ So what? "Faster decisions, fewer meetings"

BENEFIT: "Make faster decisions with always-current data"
```

## Problem 3: Weak Headlines

### Symptoms
- Generic: "Welcome to our product"
- Vague: "The future of data management"
- Feature-focused: "Advanced API integration"
- No hook, users scroll past

### Root Cause
- Starting with product, not problem/benefit
- Trying to be clever instead of clear
- Not testing variations
- No emotional hook

### Solution

**Headline Formula Bank:**

```markdown
1. Outcome + Timeframe
"Ship your MVP in 2 weeks, not 2 months"

2. Problem + Solution
"Tired of manual data entry? Automate it in 3 clicks"

3. Before → After
"From 100 support tickets to 10. Here's how."

4. Question (if genuinely compelling)
"Spending 5 hours/week on [task]?"

5. Specific Benefit
"Save $500/month on [expense]"

6. Contrarian/Bold
"Stop using [popular tool]. Here's why."
```

**Weak → Strong transformations:**

```markdown
❌ "Welcome to APIMonitor"
✅ "Know when your API breaks before your users do"

❌ "Advanced dashboard solutions"
✅ "Build dashboards in 5 minutes, not 5 hours"

❌ "The future of documentation"
✅ "Turn code into docs while you sleep"

❌ "Innovative workflow tools"
✅ "Cut your team meetings in half"
```

**Testing Headlines:**

Run through this checklist:
- [ ] Does it mention a specific benefit/outcome?
- [ ] Is it clear what the product does?
- [ ] Would you click on this as a user?
- [ ] Is it under 12 words? (ideal for scanning)
- [ ] Does it avoid jargon/buzzwords?

## Problem 4: Long, Rambling Copy

### Symptoms
- Paragraphs with 8+ sentences
- No white space
- Users scan instead of read
- Key points buried

### Root Cause
- Writing stream-of-consciousness
- Not editing for brevity
- Afraid of being too short
- Not using formatting

### Solution

**The Ruthless Edit:**

```markdown
❌ BEFORE (156 words):
"Our product is a comprehensive solution that has been designed to help businesses of all sizes manage their customer relationships more effectively. We understand that in today's competitive marketplace, maintaining strong connections with your customers is absolutely crucial for success. That's why we've built a platform that combines powerful features with an intuitive interface that anyone can use, regardless of their technical expertise.

Our CRM works for teams of 5 or 500. Simple interface, powerful features, 24/7 support.

Flexible pricing starts at $10/month.

Try it free for 14 days. No credit card required."
```

**Formatting for Scannability:**

```markdown
BAD (wall of text):
APIWatch monitors your endpoints 24/7 and sends instant alerts when something breaks so you can fix issues before users notice we check every 30 seconds from 10 global locations and integrate with Slack Discord email and SMS you get detailed logs response times and uptime analytics all for $29 per month

GOOD (scannable):
**What APIWatch does:**

• Monitors endpoints 24/7
• Checks every 30 seconds from 10 locations
• Sends instant alerts (Slack, Discord, email, SMS)
• Provides detailed logs and analytics

**Pricing:** $29/month

**Try it:** 14-day free trial
```

**Copy Length Guidelines:**

| Content Type | Target Length |
|--------------|---------------|
| Headline | 6-12 words |
| Subheadline | 10-20 words |
| Paragraph | 2-4 sentences max |
| Bullet points | 1 sentence each |
| Product description | 50-150 words |
| Landing page | 300-600 words total |
| Blog post | 800-1500 words |

## Problem 5: No Call-to-Action (or weak CTA)

### Symptoms
- Generic "Click here" or "Learn more"
- Multiple competing CTAs
- CTA doesn't match page context
- No urgency or clarity

### Root Cause
- Not thinking about user journey
- Afraid to be direct
- Trying to appeal to everyone
- No clear next step

### Solution

**CTA Formula:**

```
[Action Verb] + [Benefit/Outcome] + [Friction Reducer]

Examples:
"Start monitoring free" (action + friction reducer)
"Get your dashboard" (action + benefit)
"See how it works" (action + low commitment)
```

**CTA Hierarchy (use ONE primary per page):**

```markdown
PRIMARY (most important action):
<button className="bg-indigo-600">
  Start Free Trial
</button>

SECONDARY (alternative):
<button className="border-gray-300">
  View Demo
</button>

TERTIARY (low priority):
<a className="text-gray-600">
  Read docs
</a>
```

**Context-Specific CTAs:**

```markdown
Landing page hero:
✅ "Start monitoring free" (action + friction reducer)
❌ "Get started" (generic)

Pricing page:
✅ "Start free trial" (clear action)
❌ "Choose plan" (vague)

Blog post:
✅ "Try [product] free" (specific)
❌ "Learn more" (unclear what you'll learn)

Email:
✅ "Set up your first dashboard →" (action + benefit)
❌ "Click here" (no context)
```

**Adding Urgency (use sparingly):**

```markdown
Time-based:
"Start your 14-day trial today"
"Join 2,000+ developers this month"

Scarcity (only if true):
"50 spots left for beta"
"Offer ends Friday"

Value-based:
"Start free (no credit card required)"
"Get instant access"
```

## Problem 6: Overpromising/Hype

### Symptoms
- "10x your revenue"
- "Revolutionary game-changer"
- "Never worry about [X] again"
- Unsubstantiated superlatives

### Root Cause
- Trying too hard to stand out
- Fear product isn't compelling enough
- Following bad marketing examples
- No specific proof points

### Solution

**Replace Hype with Specifics:**

```markdown
❌ "Increase your conversions"
✅ "Increase sign-ups by an average of 20%"

❌ "Save tons of time"
✅ "Save 5 hours per week on manual data entry"

❌ "Revolutionary AI technology"
✅ "GPT-4 powered document generation"

❌ "Never lose data again"
✅ "Automatic backups every hour"

❌ "Best tool for developers"
✅ "Used by 2,000+ developers at Google and Stripe"
```

**The Proof Pyramid (use the best you have):**

```
Level 1 (Best): Real numbers from users
"Saved Sarah 10 hours/week" (with testimonial)

Level 2: Your own data
"Average user saves 5 hours/week"

Level 3: Process description
"Automate reports that usually take 2 hours"

Level 4: Comparison
"3x faster than manual export"

Level 5 (Avoid): Vague claims
"Save time" (how much? doing what?)
```

**Honest Copy Builds Trust:**

```markdown
INSTEAD OF: "Never deal with bugs again!"

TRY: "Catch bugs faster with real-time error tracking. We'll alert you in Slack within seconds of an issue."

INSTEAD OF: "10x your productivity overnight!"

TRY: "Most users save 5-10 hours per week on repetitive tasks."

INSTEAD OF: "The only tool you'll ever need!"

TRY: "Integrates with your existing tools (Slack, GitHub, Notion)."
```

## Problem 7: Writing for Wrong Audience

### Symptoms
- Technical jargon for non-technical users
- Too simple for expert users
- Generic "for businesses" messaging
- Wrong pain points mentioned

### Root Cause
- Didn't research target audience
- Trying to appeal to everyone
- Assuming your experience = their experience
- No user interviews

### Solution

**Audience Research Checklist:**

Before writing, answer:
- [ ] Who is the target user specifically? (job title, company size)
- [ ] What's their biggest pain point related to your product?
- [ ] What language do they use? (technical vs. plain English)
- [ ] Where do they hang out online? (Reddit, Twitter, forums)
- [ ] What alternatives are they using today?
- [ ] What would make them switch?

**Audience-Specific Copy:**

```markdown
SAME PRODUCT, DIFFERENT AUDIENCES:

For Developers:
"Monitor API endpoints with sub-second latency. Self-host or use our cloud. Integrates with GitHub Actions, Slack, and PagerDuty."

For Non-Technical Founders:
"Get notified in Slack when your website goes down. No setup, no code. Works in 2 minutes."

For Enterprise:
"Enterprise-grade uptime monitoring with SOC 2 compliance, SSO integration, and dedicated support. 99.99% SLA guaranteed."
```

**Language Calibration:**

```markdown
Too Technical (for non-tech users):
"RESTful API with OAuth 2.0 authentication and webhook callbacks"

Just Right:
"Connect your account in one click. We'll notify you when things change."

Too Simple (for developer users):
"It makes your app work better with other apps"

Just Right:
"REST API with OAuth 2.0 and webhook support"
```
