## Stop losing users to downtime

Your API is the backbone of your product. When it goes down, users get frustrated, support tickets flood in, and revenue stops. By the time you notice, the damage is done.

Manual checks don't scale. Logging into dashboards wastes time. You need to know the instant something breaks.

---

## How APIWatch works

### 1. Connect your API (30 seconds)
Add your endpoint URL and expected response. We'll start monitoring immediately.

### 2. Choose your alerts (1 minute)
Get notified in Slack, Discord, email, or SMS. Set up custom rules for different endpoints.

### 3. Relax (forever)
We check your API every 30 seconds from 10 global locations. You'll know before your users do.

---

## What you get

**Real-time monitoring**
Checks every 30 seconds from 10 locations worldwide. Catch issues instantly.

**Smart alerts**
Only get notified when it matters. No spam, just critical alerts when your API actually fails.

**Detailed insights**
See response times, error rates, and uptime trends. Know what broke and when.

**Status page**
Share a public status page with your users. Build trust with transparency.

**Team collaboration**
Add your whole team. Everyone sees the same alerts and can respond faster.

## "We caught a breaking change 30 seconds after deploy"

"APIWatch saved us from a production incident. We pushed bad code at 2am, got a Slack alert, and rolled back before anyone noticed. Worth every penny."

— Sarah Chen, CTO @ DataFlow

## Example 2: Product Hunt Launch

### User Request
"Write a Product Hunt launch for my AI documentation generator."

### Output

#### Product Name
DocuGenius - AI Documentation from Code

#### Tagline (60 characters)
Turn your code into docs in minutes, not hours

#### Description

```markdown
## The Problem

Developers hate writing documentation. It's tedious, time-consuming, and always outdated. Your team asks the same questions over and over. New hires take weeks to ramp up.

## Our Solution

DocuGenius reads your code and generates comprehensive documentation automatically. Upload a file, get beautiful markdown docs. It understands your functions, classes, and logic, then explains them in plain English.

## Who This Is For

Solo developers and small teams who want great docs without the manual work.

## Key Features

**Smart Analysis:** Understands 8 programming languages (JS, Python, Go, Rust, Java, PHP, Ruby, Swift)

**Multiple Formats:** Generate API references, tutorials, or README files - choose your style

**GitHub Integration:** Connect your repo and bulk-generate docs for entire projects

**Always Up-to-Date:** Regenerate docs whenever you push code

**Copy-Paste Ready:** Download as Markdown, publish anywhere

**Fast:** Average file documented in under 10 seconds

## Why We Built This

I spent 3 hours last week documenting a simple API. That's 3 hours I could've spent building features. I built DocuGenius because I was tired of choosing between good docs and shipping fast.

## What's Next

We're adding:
- Real-time sync with GitHub (auto-update docs on every commit)
- Diagram generation (visualize architecture)
- Multi-language support (Spanish, Portuguese, French)

Your feedback will shape the roadmap. What would make this perfect for you?

#### First Comment (Maker's Comment)

```markdown
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Your Name], maker of DocuGenius.

**Quick backstory:** I built 3 side projects last year. All of them had terrible documentation because I hate writing docs. Users were confused, support requests piled up, and I felt guilty.

So I built this. Upload your code, get docs. Simple.

**What I'd love feedback on:**
1. Which doc style do you prefer? (API reference, tutorial, README)
2. What languages should we support next?
3. Would you use this for existing projects or just new ones?

**Special offer for PH community:**
First 100 users get 3 months Pro free with code PRODUCTHUNT100

Happy to answer any questions! 🚀

### Output

```
1/6

I've built 5 SaaS products.

Every time, I wasted 2 weeks on the same setup:
→ Auth
→ Payments
→ Database
→ Email

No more.

2/6

Introducing ShipFast → A Next.js 14 starter with everything built-in.

Clone the repo, add your keys, deploy to Vercel.

4/6

Perfect for:

## Example 5: About Page (Founder Story)

### User Request
"Write an About page that's personal but professional."

### Output

```markdown
# About DashForge

## The Story

In 2023, I built my third SaaS product.

Again, I spent 10 hours building an admin dashboard from scratch. Copy-pasted components from old projects. Fought with chart libraries. Tweaked responsive layouts.

I thought: "There has to be a better way."

So I built DashForge - a tool that generates dashboard code from database connections.

No more rebuilding the same thing every project.

## Why It Exists

Most developers waste 5-10 hours on admin dashboards for every new project. That's time you could spend on features that make your product unique.

DashForge is for developers who want to ship, not setup.

## Who I Am

I'm [Your Name], a solo developer from [City].

I've built:
- [Product 1] - [what it does]
- [Product 2] - [what it does]
- [Product 3] - [what it does]

I love building tools that save developers time. DashForge is my biggest time-saver yet.

## What's Next

DashForge is a solo project. It's profitable, actively maintained, and growing.

The roadmap:
- Real-time data updates (Q2 2024)
- More template designs (monthly)
- MongoDB support (Q3 2024)
- Collaborative editing (Q4 2024)

Your feedback drives the roadmap. [Tell me what you need](mailto:hello@dashforge.com).
