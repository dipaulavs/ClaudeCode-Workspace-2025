# Core Four Methods (from $100M Leads)

The four proven ways to get leads, ordered by effort and scalability.

---

## Overview: Core Four

| Method | Effort | Cost | Speed | Scale | Control |
|--------|--------|------|-------|-------|---------|
| **#1 Warm Outreach** | Low | $0 | Fast | Low | High |
| **#2 Content** | Medium | $0-Low | Slow | High | High |
| **#3 Cold Outreach** | High | Low | Fast | Medium | High |
| **#4 Paid Ads** | Low | High | Fast | Unlimited | Low |

**The Roadmap:** Start with #1 (warm), add #2 (content), test #3 (cold), scale with #4 (paid ads).

---

## Method #1: Warm Outreach

**Definition:** Reach out to people who already know you (past clients, network, social media connections).

### Why Start Here
- Zero cost
- Immediate results (can close today)
- Builds confidence (easier than cold)
- Validates offer before spending money

### The Process

**Step 1: Make The List**
Who already knows you?
- Past clients/customers
- Past coworkers
- Friends/family
- Social media connections (Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram)
- Email list (if you have one)
- People you've helped before (for free)

**Minimum viable list: 100 people**

**Step 2: Personalized Message**
Template (customize for each person):
```
Hey [Name],

[Personal reference - something specific about them]

I'm [what you do now]. Helping [target market] [dream outcome] in [timeline].

Thought of you because [specific reason].

Are you open to [specific next step]?

[Your Name]
```

**Example:**
```
Hey Sarah,

Saw your post about the new house - congrats!

I'm helping real estate agents get 20+ qualified leads/month without cold calling.

Thought of you because I remember you mentioning how much you hate prospecting.

Are you open to a 15-min call this week to see if it's a fit?

Mike
```

**Step 3: Follow Up**
- Day 3: If no response, follow up once
- Day 7: If still no response, move on
- Don't be pushy (warm outreach becomes cold quickly)

### Volume Requirements
- Reach out to 10-20 people/day
- Expect 30-50% response rate
- Expect 10-20% conversion to call
- Close 30-50% of calls

**Math:** 100 people → 30-50 responses → 10-20 calls → 3-10 clients

### Common Mistakes
❌ Generic copy-paste messages
❌ Asking for money immediately
❌ No personal reference
❌ Following up more than once
❌ Being salesy in first message

✅ Personalized every message
✅ Ask for call/meeting (not sale)
✅ Include specific memory/reference
✅ One follow-up max
✅ Provide value upfront

---

## Method #2: Post Free Content

**Definition:** Create valuable content that attracts your target market to you (organic social media, SEO, YouTube).

### Why Content Works
- Compounds over time (evergreen)
- Pre-qualifies leads (they come educated)
- Builds authority (seen as expert)
- Scales infinitely (one post → unlimited views)

### Content Frameworks

#### A) Hook-Retain-Reward (Hormozi's Framework)

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
- Use contradiction hook (see `hook_examples.md`)
- Make them stop scrolling
- Promise specific outcome

**Retain (middle section):**
- Tell story (personal failure → turn → success)
- Open loops (create curiosity)
- Use pattern interrupts (unexpected statements)
- Give tactical value (but not complete solution)

**Reward (last 10%):**
- Summarize value delivered
- Clear CTA (what to do next)
- Link in bio/comments

**Example (60-second Reel):**
```
HOOK (0-3s):
"Lost 45 lbs eating pizza twice a week after 8 years of keto."

RETAIN (3-55s):
"For 8 years I tried keto. Lost 12 lbs, gained it back plus more.
Hated it. Felt miserable.

One day my nutritionist asked: 'What if the problem isn't WHAT
you eat, but WHEN you eat it?'

Changed my eating window. Still ate pizza. Lost 45 lbs in 120 days.

Here's what I learned: [3 tactical tips]"

REWARD (55-60s):
"If you want the exact protocol I used, link in bio.
Drop '🍕' in comments if you want more content like this."
```

#### B) Content Types by Platform

**Instagram/TikTok/YouTube Shorts:**
- 7-60 seconds
- Hook in first 3 seconds
- One clear lesson
- Strong CTA at end

**YouTube Long-Form:**
- 8-20 minutes
- Same Hook-Retain-Reward structure
- Multiple value nuggets
- Link to lead magnet in description

**LinkedIn/Twitter/Threads:**
- Text-based
- Hook in first line
- Story in middle
- CTA at end

**Blog/SEO:**
- 1,500-3,000 words
- Keyword optimized (search intent)
- Comprehensive solution
- Lead magnet at end

### Content Formula: "More Better New"

**More:** Post more frequently
- Instagram/TikTok: 1-3x/day minimum
- YouTube Shorts: 1-2x/day
- YouTube Long: 3-7x/week
- LinkedIn: 1x/day

**Better:** Improve quality each post
- Better hooks (test variations)
- Better retention (watch time metrics)
- Better CTAs (track click-through)

**New:** Try new platforms/formats
- If on Instagram, add TikTok
- If doing Reels, add YouTube Shorts
- If doing shorts, add long-form

### Lead Magnets (The Bridge)

**Definition:** Free value in exchange for contact info.

**Types:**
- PDF Guide: "The 7-Step [Process] to [Dream Outcome]"
- Video Training: "How to [Solve Problem] in [Timeline]"
- Calculator/Tool: "[Outcome] Calculator"
- Template/Checklist: "[Process] Template"
- Quiz/Assessment: "What's Your [Score] Score?"

**Requirements:**
- Solves ONE specific problem
- Deliverable immediately (automated)
- Takes 10-30 minutes to consume
- Leads naturally to your paid offer

**Example:**
```
Content: "Lost 45 lbs eating pizza 2x/week"
Lead Magnet: "The Pizza Protocol: 7-Day Meal Plan"
Paid Offer: "90-Day Body Transformation Coaching"
```

### Volume Requirements
- Post 1-3x/day for 90 days minimum
- Expect slow start (0-100 followers)
- Momentum builds around 1,000 followers
- Scale kicks in at 10,000+ followers

**Timeline:**
- Month 1-3: 0-1 lead/day (building audience)
- Month 4-6: 1-5 leads/day (momentum)
- Month 7-12: 5-20+ leads/day (scale)

---

## Method #3: Cold Outreach

**Definition:** Reach out to people who don't know you (cold email, cold DM, cold calls).

### Why Cold Outreach
- Unlimited supply (anyone is reachable)
- Fast results (leads today)
- Highly targetable (pick exactly who)
- Predictable (volume = leads)

### The Process

**Step 1: Build The List**
Who is your perfect customer?
- Use LinkedIn (filters by industry, title, location)
- Use scrapers (Hunter.io, Apollo.io for emails)
- Use Instagram/Facebook (niche hashtags)
- Buy lists (less effective but fast)

**Target:** 1,000+ contacts

**Step 2: Personalization at Scale**
You can't personalize 1,000 messages individually. Use:

**Variables:**
- {{firstName}}
- {{company}}
- {{recentPost}} (their latest LinkedIn post)
- {{commonConnection}} (mutual connection)

**Template:**
```
Hey {{firstName}},

Saw {{company}} recently [specific observation].

Quick question: Are you still [pain point relevant to their industry]?

We help [similar companies] [dream outcome] in [timeline] without [sacrifice].

[Company A] added [specific result] in [timeline].

Worth a 15-min call?

[Your Name]
```

**Example:**
```
Hey Mike,

Saw your LinkedIn post about hiring challenges last week.

Quick question: Are you still struggling to find qualified sales reps?

We help B2B companies hire 3-5 vetted sales reps in 30 days without
spending 6 months recruiting.

TechCorp added 4 reps in 28 days (2 are now top performers).

Worth a 15-min call this week?

Sarah
```

**Step 3: Volume & Testing**
- Send 50-100 messages/day
- Test 3 variations (A/B/C)
- Track metrics (open, reply, booked)
- Double down on winner

**Expected Metrics:**
- Cold Email: 1-3% reply rate → 20-30% book call
- Cold DM: 10-30% reply rate → 10-20% book call
- Cold Call: 2-5% answer → 20-40% book call

**Math (Cold Email):**
100 emails/day × 2% reply = 2 replies
2 replies × 25% book = 0.5 calls/day
0.5 calls × 30% close = 0.15 clients/day
0.15 clients × 30 days = 4-5 clients/month

### Platforms Ranked by Effectiveness

1. **Cold DM (Instagram/LinkedIn)** - Highest reply rate
2. **Cold Email** - Most scalable
3. **Cold Call** - Fastest to close
4. **Cold Mail** (physical) - Highest perceived value (but expensive)

### Common Mistakes
❌ No personalization (feels spammy)
❌ Pitching in first message (too salesy)
❌ No clear CTA (what's next step?)
❌ Following up 5+ times (becomes harassment)
❌ Not tracking metrics (can't improve)

✅ Personalize first line (company/recent post)
✅ Ask question first (engage, don't pitch)
✅ Clear next step (book call link)
✅ 2-3 follow-ups max
✅ Track everything (test variations)

## Method #4: Run Paid Ads

**Definition:** Pay platforms (Facebook, Google, YouTube, TikTok) to show your offer to your target market.

### Why Paid Ads
- Unlimited scale (budget = leads)
- Fast feedback (know in 48 hours if it works)
- Precise targeting (age, location, interests)
- Compound learning (data improves over time)

### The Framework

**Step 1: Choose Platform**
Match platform to market:
- **Facebook/Instagram:** Local services, B2C, 30-65 age
- **Google:** High intent (searching for solution)
- **YouTube:** Educational products, B2B
- **TikTok:** Younger demographic (18-35), viral products
- **LinkedIn:** B2B, high-ticket

**Start with ONE platform. Master it before adding more.**

**Step 2: Create The Ad**
Use Hook-Retain-Reward framework (see Method #2):

**Components:**
1. **Hook:** First 3 seconds (contradiction, numbers)
2. **Body:** Value + story (30-60 seconds)
3. **CTA:** Clear next step (link to lead magnet)

**Format Options:**
- Image + Text (cheapest to test)
- Carousel (multiple selling points)
- Video (highest engagement)
- Story/Reel (native to platform)

**Example Ad (Meta Ads - Image + Text):**
```
PRIMARY TEXT (Hook):
"Lost 45 lbs eating pizza 2x/week (after 8 years of keto)."

BODY:
"For 8 years I tried keto. Hated it. Gained weight.

One question from my nutritionist changed everything:
'What if the problem isn't WHAT you eat, but WHEN?'

I changed my eating window. Still ate pizza. Lost 45 lbs in 120 days.

I created a 7-day protocol that 342 people used to lose 8+ lbs in first month."

CTA:
"Download the free Pizza Protocol 👇"

HEADLINE:
"The Pizza Protocol: Lose Weight Eating What You Love"

DESCRIPTION:
"7-day meal plan + eating window guide (free PDF)"
```

**Step 3: Target Audience**
**Broad to start** (let algorithm find your customer):
- Age range: 25-65
- Location: Your service area (or worldwide for digital)
- Interests: 3-5 relevant (fitness, weight loss, nutrition)

**Don't over-narrow** (algorithm needs room to optimize).

**Step 4: Budget & Timeline**
- Start: $20-50/day minimum
- Test: Run for 7 days before making decisions
- Scale: Increase by 20% every 3 days if profitable

**Expected Metrics:**
- Cost per lead: $2-20 (varies by industry)
- Lead to call: 30-50%
- Call to close: 20-40%

**Math:**
$50/day ÷ $10 cost per lead = 5 leads/day
5 leads × 40% book call = 2 calls/day
2 calls × 30% close = 0.6 clients/day
0.6 clients × 30 days = 18 clients/month

**Step 5: Optimize (More Better New)**
- **More:** Increase budget (if profitable)
- **Better:** Improve creative (test new hooks)
- **New:** Add new platforms (if maxed out)

### Common Mistakes
❌ Testing multiple platforms at once
❌ Not running long enough (7 days minimum)
❌ Complicated funnels (too many steps)
❌ Selling in ad (should lead to lead magnet)
❌ Scaling unprofitable ads

✅ One platform at a time
✅ 7-day minimum test
✅ Simple funnel (ad → lead magnet → call)
✅ Give value in ad (save sale for call)
✅ Only scale profitable ads (positive ROI)

## The Roadmap: Which Method When?

### Phase 1: $0-10k/month (Start Here)
**Primary:** Warm Outreach (#1)
**Secondary:** Content (#2) - Start posting daily
**Goal:** 10-20 clients from warm market while building audience

### Phase 2: $10k-30k/month (Add Leverage)

### Phase 3: $30k-100k/month (Scale)
**Primary:** Paid Ads (#4) - Only when offers convert consistently
**Secondary:** Content (#2) - Continue for authority/trust
**Goal:** Predictable lead flow from ads

### Phase 4: $100k+/month (Optimize)
**All Four Running:**
- Warm: Referrals from existing clients
- Content: Organic inbound (builds brand)
- Cold: Fill gaps when ads are expensive

## Resource Requirements

| Method | Time/Day | Money | Skills Needed |
|--------|----------|-------|---------------|
| Warm Outreach | 1-2 hours | $0 | Writing, follow-up |
| Content | 2-4 hours | $0-500 | Hook writing, editing |
| Cold Outreach | 2-4 hours | $50-200 | Research, copywriting |
| Paid Ads | 1-2 hours | $500+ | Creative testing, data analysis |

**Reality:** You need time OR money. If you have time, do #1-3. If you have money, do #4.

**Best case:** Do all four. More channels = more leads = less dependency on any one method.
