We don't have capacity for more 1-on-1 clients.

But we created a group program with the same curriculum
for $997.

It's not 1-on-1, but you get the same content plus
peer accountability."
```

**Best for:** High-ticket offers, overcoming price objection.

#### D) Rollover Upsell
**What:** Transfer unused value to new purchase.

**Structure:** "You didn't use X, roll it into upgraded Y."

Upgrade to our 365-Day Transformation for $497 more
(60% off), and we'll add your unused 60 days.

You'll get 425 days total of coaching + meal plans."

**Best for:** Overcoming cash flow objection.

**Structure:**
```
"Can't do $997 today?

How about 3 monthly payments of $397?

Same program, just spread out."
```

**Structure:**
```
"Not sure if it's for you?

Try it for $1 for 7 days.

If you don't love it, cancel. Keep everything.

If you stay, $497 total ($496 due on day 8)."
```

**Psychology:** Most don't cancel (inertia + sunk cost).

#### C) Feature Downsell
**What:** Remove features to reduce price.

**Examples:**
- Remove coaching (save $500)
- Remove templates (save $200)

After 90 days, continue for $197/month (cancel anytime).
Most clients stay for 6+ months."
```

#### B) Continuity Discount Offers

```

**Step 3: Upsell (Classic)**
```
"Add Done-For-You [Service] for just $147 today (50% off)"

```

**Step 4: Continuity (Bonus)**
```
"Get first month of ongoing coaching free ($97 value).
After 90 days, continue for $97/month or cancel."
→ 50% continue past 90 days

```

**Step 4: Continuity (Discount)**
```
"After your project, continue with monthly maintenance:

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Too Many Offers at Once
Showing everything confuses customers.
**Fix:** One offer at a time. Linear sequence.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Upselling Unrelated Products
"Bought course? Want a webinar on crypto?"
**Fix:** Upsell must be logical next step.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Not Testing Downsells
Letting "no" be final answer.
**Fix:** Always have 1-2 downsell options ready.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Forgetting Continuity
Treating customer as one-time transaction.
**Fix:** Every business should have recurring offer.

### ❌ Mistake 5: Complicated Funnels
14 different offers in first interaction.
**Fix:** Simple sequence: Attract → Core → Upsell → Continuity.
