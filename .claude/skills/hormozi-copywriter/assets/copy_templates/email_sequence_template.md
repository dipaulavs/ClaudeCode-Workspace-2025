## Email 1: Origin Story (Day 1)

**Subject Line:** How I [contradiction hook]

**Body:**
```
Subject: How I [lost 45 lbs eating pizza / made $0 for 3 years then $1.2M]

Hey [Name],

[Contradiction hook with numbers]

Let me tell you how that happened.

[BACKSTORY - The Struggle]
For [timeline], I [what you tried].

Spent [money/time invested].

Result? [Terrible outcome].

[THE TURN]
Then [authority figure / event] showed me [insight].

I changed [ONE specific thing].

[RESULT]
In [short timeline]: [Specific result with numbers]

[LESSON]
The lesson? [Counter-intuitive insight].

Most people [what they do wrong].

Instead, [what actually works].

[SOFT CTA]
I'll share more about [method] in tomorrow's email.

For now, curious: What's your biggest struggle with [problem]?

Hit reply and let me know.

[Your Name]

P.S. [Teaser for next email]
```

**Example:**
```
Subject: How I lost 45 lbs eating pizza twice a week

Hey Sarah,

I lost 45 lbs in 120 days eating pizza twice a week.

Let me tell you how that happened.

For 8 years, I tried keto.

Spent $4,300 on supplements, meal plans, and coaches.

Result? Lost 12 lbs, gained it back plus 7 more.

Then my nutritionist asked me ONE question:
"What if the problem isn't WHAT you eat, but WHEN?"

I changed my eating window. Still ate pizza.

In 120 days: Down 45 lbs. Visible abs. Size 6 jeans.

The lesson? Restriction doesn't work long-term.

Most people eliminate foods (pizza, bread, sugar).

Instead, you need to work WITH your biology, not against it.

I'll share more about the eating window protocol tomorrow.

For now, curious: What's your biggest struggle with weight loss?

Hit reply and let me know.

Mike

P.S. Tomorrow I'll reveal the one mistake 89% of people make
that sabotages their progress (even when eating "healthy").

**Example:**
```
Subject: Emily's results: Lost 22 lbs in 90 days (size 12 → size 6)

Hey Sarah,

Quick story about Emily.

When she started, she was:
• 174 lbs - highest weight ever
• Tired by 2pm - needed 2 coffees daily
• Bloated - nothing fit comfortably

She thought she needed MORE restriction.

I showed her data: 97% of restrictive diets fail within 2 years.

We did three things:
1. Eating window protocol - Lost water weight in 7 days
2. Strategic refeeds - Pizza Friday kept her sane
3. Zero calorie counting - Followed portion guide instead

In 90 days:
• 22 lbs down - 152 lbs total
• Size 6 jeans - from size 12
• Zero bloating - energy until 8pm

The key? We worked WITH her cravings, not against them.

Not elimination diets.

But strategic timing and portion control.

Want results like Emily's?

We have 7 spots left in Bridal Body Program this month.

Reply "INTERESTED" and I'll send details.

Mike

P.S. Tomorrow I'll share how Jessica lost 18 lbs in 60 days
while eating out 3x/week (even Chipotle).

[CONTEXT]
[Client Name] was skeptical.

She'd tried:

**Example:**
```
Subject: "I thought it was too good to be true"

Hey Sarah,

Got this message yesterday from Rachel:

"I lost 19 lbs in 10 weeks eating pizza, pasta, and bread.
I thought it was too good to be true. Mike proved me wrong.
I fit into my wedding dress with 2 weeks to spare. Worth
every penny."

Rachel was skeptical.

She'd tried:
• Weight Watchers - Lost 5 lbs, gained back 12
• Keto - Made it 3 weeks, quit (too restrictive)
• Bootcamp gym - 6am classes, saw zero results

When she found Bridal Body Program, she thought
"This sounds like a scam."

She started January 8th. Did exactly what we said.

10 weeks later:
• 19 lbs down
• Fit into dress (size 8)
• Zero restriction (ate pizza weekly)

She's not alone:

• Emily: 22 lbs in 90 days
• Jessica: 18 lbs in 60 days (eating out 3x/week)
• Lauren: 15 lbs in 8 weeks (with 2 vacation trips)

All using the same Bridal Body Method.

If you want the same results, here's what to do:

Reply "SEND INFO" and I'll send:
• Full program details
• Pricing + guarantee
• Next available start date

Only 5 spots left this month.

## Email 9: Final Reminder (Day 9)

**Subject Line:** Last chance: [Deadline in hours]

**Body:**
```
Subject: Last chance: Closes tonight at midnight

Hey [Name],

This is the last email about [Offer Name].

Enrollment closes tonight at midnight.

If you've been on the fence, here's my honest take:

[DIRECT TALK]
This program works IF:
• You [requirement 1]
• You [requirement 2]
• You [requirement 3]

It's NOT for you if:
• You [disqualifier 1]
• You [disqualifier 2]

[FINAL REMINDER]
If you're ready:

• [Dream outcome] in [timeline]
• [Guarantee]
• Only [number] spots left

Reply "I'M IN" by midnight.

If I don't hear from you, I'll assume it's not a fit
and won't email again about this.

[Your Name]

P.S. [One final objection addressed]
```

**Example:**
```
Subject: Last chance: Closes tonight at midnight

Hey Sarah,

This is the last email about Bridal Body Program.

Enrollment closes tonight at midnight.

If you've been on the fence, here's my honest take:

This program works IF:
• You can dedicate 20 min/day
• You're willing to follow the eating window protocol
• You have 8+ weeks before your wedding

It's NOT for you if:
• You want instant results (no magic pills here)
• You're not willing to track your meals

If you're ready:

• Lose 20 lbs in 12 weeks (or full refund)
• Fit into your wedding dress
• Only 2 spots left this month

Reply "I'M IN" by midnight.

If I don't hear from you, I'll assume it's not a fit
and won't email again about this.

Mike

P.S. Common question: "Can I still eat at my bachelorette party?"
Yes. The protocol includes 2 "free days" per week where you can
eat whatever you want (within reason).
```
