## What's a Swipe File?

A **swipe file** is a collection of proven copy examples you can reference (not copy directly) when writing your own.

**How to use:**
1. Find example similar to what you need
2. Analyze the structure (not the words)
3. Apply the same pattern to your niche
4. Make it your own (never copy-paste)

## Categories to Study

### 1. YouTube Hooks (First 3 Seconds)
**Pattern:** Contradiction + Numbers

**Examples:**
```
"I made $0 for 3 years. Then I changed one word..."
"Worked 16 hours a day for 8 years. Made $200k/year..."
"Lost my entire business in 2019. Made $12M in 2020..."
```

**What to extract:**
- Contradiction formula (X effort → Y poor result → Z minimal change → W massive result)
- Number density (minimum 3 numbers in first 10 seconds)
- Timeline specificity (years, months, days - never "quickly" or "soon")

### 2. Email Subject Lines
**Pattern:** Direct + Curiosity + Numbers

**Examples:**
```
"The $1.7M typo"
"Why I fired 47% of my staff"
"The 3-word close (closes 73% of deals)"
```

**What to extract:**
- Curiosity without clickbait (specific but not fully revealed)
- Numbers in unexpected places (typo = $1.7M, staff = 47%, words = 3)
- No hype words ("amazing", "incredible", "life-changing")

### 3. Meta Ads Primary Text
**Pattern:** Hook + Mini-Story + CTA

**Example:**
```
"I lost $4.7M in 2019. Made $17M in 2020.

Here's what I changed:

[3 tactical bullets]

If you want the full breakdown, I created a free training: [link]"
```

**What to extract:**
- Hook first (always contradiction)
- Story compressed to 3-5 sentences
- Tactical value given (not just "sign up to learn")
- CTA to lead magnet (not direct sale)

### 4. Landing Page Headlines
**Pattern:** Dream Outcome + Timeline + Method Name

**Examples:**
```
"Add $100k/year in profit in 12 months with the Gym Launch System"
"Get 6-pack abs in 90 days with the 6-Week Shred"
"Scale to $1M/year in 18 months with the Acquisition Model"
```

**What to extract:**
- Specific outcome ($100k, not "more money")
- Exact timeline (12 months, not "fast")
- Named methodology (makes it proprietary)

### 5. Offer Stacks
**Pattern:** Core + Bonuses + Value + Price + Guarantee

**Example structure:**
```
CORE: [Program Name] - $[X]
  [What it does in one sentence]

BONUSES:
• [Bonus 1]: ($[value])
• [Bonus 2]: ($[value])
• [Bonus 3]: ($[value])

Total Value: $[sum]
Your Price: $[actual]
You Save: $[difference]

GUARANTEE: [Specific result] or [consequence]
```

**What to extract:**
- Bonus values are 1-2x core price (believable, not outrageous)
- Each bonus solves ONE specific problem
- Guarantee is outcome-based (not "satisfaction")
- Savings shown explicitly (you save $X)

## How to Build Your Own Swipe File

### Step 1: Collect Raw Examples
Create folders for:
- `/hooks` - First 3 seconds of videos
- `/emails` - Subject lines + full emails
- `/ads` - Meta/Google ad screenshots
- `/landing_pages` - Full page screenshots
- `/offer_stacks` - Pricing/offer structures

### Step 2: Analyze Structure
For each example, note:
- **Pattern used:** (contradiction, authority failure, minimal change, etc.)
- **Numbers count:** (how many specific numbers?)
- **Timeline:** (how specific? days/months/years?)
- **Objection addressed:** (what fear/doubt does it overcome?)

### Step 3: Extract Templates
Turn structure into fill-in-the-blank:
```
Example: "Lost $4.7M in 2019. Made $17M in 2020."

Template: "Lost $[X] in [Year]. Made $[Y] in [Year+1]."

Your version: "Lost 45 lbs in 2022. Gained back 12 lbs in 2023."
```

### Step 4: Test Variations
Create 3-5 versions using same structure:
- Different numbers
- Different timeline
- Different contradiction angle
- Different proof source

## Red Flags (What NOT to Copy)

### ❌ Don't Copy These Elements:
1. **His personal story** - Use your own or client stories
2. **His specific numbers** - Use your own data
3. **His company names** - Create your own (Gym Launch → Your Brand)
4. **His exact wording** - Structure yes, words no

### ✅ DO Copy These Elements:
1. **The pattern** - How he structures the hook
2. **The density** - How many numbers per sentence
3. **The flow** - Hook → Story → CTA sequence
4. **The simplicity** - Direct language, no fluff
