VALUE OFFER: THE VALUE EQUATION
“We question all of our beliefs, except for the ones we really believe in, and those we never think to question.”
ORSON SCOTT CARD
want to be abundantly clear: the goal should be to charge as much money for your products or services as humanly
possible. I'm talking heinous amounts of money. That being said, anyone can raise their prices, but only a select few can
charge these rates 
and get people to say yes
.
From this point forward, you must abandon any notion you have about “what's fair.” Every enormous company in the world
charges you money for things that cost them nothing. It costs pennies for the phone company to add an additional user, except
they don’t mind charging you hundreds per month for access. It costs pennies to manufacture pharmaceutical drugs, but they
don’t mind charging hundreds of dollars a month for it. Media companies charge advertisers a king’s ransom for your eyeballs,
and it costs them next to nothing to get you to like kitten photos on social media. You 
need
 to have a big discrepancy between
what something costs you and what you charge for it. It is the only way to be unreasonably successful.
Many entrepreneurs believe that charging “too much” is bad. The reality is that, yes, you should never charge more than
your product is 
worth
. But you should charge 
far
 more for your product and services than it costs to fulfill it. Think up to a
hundred times more, not just two or three times more. And if you provide enough 
value
, it should still always be a 
steal 
for the
prospect. That is the power of value. It unleashes unlimited pricing and profit
 
power to scale your company.
For example, one of my private clients (whose company I have equity in) is in the photography space. Over two years,
implementing the tactics outlined in this book, the owner was able to increase the average ticket from $300 to $1,500. That’s a
5x increase (gasp). Even cooler, they now spend less time per customer, and have 
higher
 customer satisfaction. The 5x
increase in average ticket, 38x’d the profit of the business. It went from making $1,000/wk in profit to $38,000/wk in profit,
and continues to grow. As a result, the company was finally able to continue to scale to multiple locations and provide
meaningful work to great employees. And a fun benefit, we were able to donate even more money to children’s charities which
is something the owner and I have in common (almost $500,000 at the time of this writing). But none of that would have been
possible without figuring out what people valued most, tripling down on it, and ruthlessly eliminating everything else. A 5x
price increase may seem crazy to you, but clients voted with their dollars that what the company provides now is 
far
 better
than what it did before. Cracking value opens up the world of unlimited profit, impact and possibilities.
Those who understand 
value
 are the ones who will be able to charge the most money for their services. The good news is
that there is a repeatable formula that I have created (I’ve never seen it displayed elsewhere) to help quantify the variables that
create value for any offer. I call it 
The Value Equation
. Once you see it, you can never unsee it. It will operate in your
subconscious, running in the background, calling out to you. It’s a new lens through which to see the world.

Equation”

gain your trust
 and deliver value in advance. As such,
it’s absolutely free. Enjoy.
As you can see from the picture, there are four primary drivers of value. Two of the drivers (on top), you will seek to
increase. The other two (on the bottom), you will seek to decrease.
1
. 
(Yay) The Dream Outcome (Goal: Increase)
2
. 
(Yay) Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (Goal: Increase)
3
. 
(Boo) Perceived Time Delay Between Start and Achievement (Goal: Decrease)
4
. 
(Boo) Perceived Effort & Sacrifice (Goal: Decrease)
If you noticed the questions in the last section that my father asked me, you’ll see they corresponded with these pillars:
What will I make? 
(Dream Outcome)
How will I know it's going to happen? 
(Perceived Likelihood of Achievement)
How long will it take? 
(Time Delay)
What is expected of me? 
(Effort & Sacrifice)
Get The Bottom To Zero
In the beginning of my career, I focused all my attention on dream outcomes and the perception of achievement (social
proof, third-party edification, etc). In other words, the top side of the equation. That’s where beginner marketers make bigger
and bigger claims. It’s easy, and it’s lazy.
But as time has gone on, I have realized that these larger-than-life claims are the easiest to establish (and therefore less
unique). After all, anyone can make a promise. The harder, and more competitive, are the Time Delay and Effort & Sacrifice.
The best companies in the world focus all their attention on the bottom side of the equation. Making things immediate,
seamless, and effortless. Apple made the iPhone effortless compared to other phones at the time. Amazon made purchasing a
single click of a button 
and
 made purchases arrive almost immediately (maybe by the time you read this, they’ll be sending
drones to our doors within 60 minutes). Netflix made consuming television immediate and effortless. So, the older I get, the
more I have shifted my focus to “the hard stuff” — decreasing the bottom side of the equation. And I believe the better you do
this, the more you will be rewarded by the marketplace.
Final note: The reason this is a division equation and not an addition (“+”) is that I wanted to convey one key point. If you

can make the bottom part of the equation equal to zero, you’re golden. No matter how small the top side is, anything divided by
zero equals infinity (which is technically undefined for the math nerds). In other words, if you can reduce your prospects' true
time delay to receiving value to zero (aka you realize your immediate dream outcome), and your effort and sacrifice is zero,
you have an infinitely valuable product. If you accomplish this, you win the game.
Given this postulate, a prospect would (in theory) purchase something from you, and the moment their credit card was run,
it would immediately become their reality. 
That
 is infinite value.
Imagine clicking the purchase button on a weight loss product and instantly seeing your stomach turn into a six-pack. Or
imagine hiring a marketing firm, and as soon as you sign your document, your phone begins ringing with new highly qualified
prospects. How valuable would these products/services be? Infinitely valuable. And that’s the point.
I don't know if we entrepreneurs will ever get there, but that is the hypothetical limit we all should strive towards, and why
I structured the equation this way.
Perception is Reality
Perception is reality. It’s not about how much you increase your prospect’s likelihood of success, or decrease the time
delay to achievement, or decrease their effort and sacrifice. That in itself is 
not
 valuable. Many times, they will have no idea.
The Grand Slam Offer only becomes valuable once the prospect 
perceives
 the increase in likelihood of achievement, 
perceives
the decrease in time delay, and
 perceives 
the decrease in effort and sacrifice.
A prime example of this happened in the London tunnel system. The biggest increase in rider satisfaction (
aka value
) was
never from faster trains to decrease wait times. Instead, it was from a simple dotted map that showed them when the next train
was coming and how long they had to wait. The dotted map, which only cost a few million dollars, decreased the riders’
perception
 of time delay and sacrifice (being bored waiting) more than actually making the trains faster (which costs billions
of dollars to do). Isn’t that cool? This is how we need to think about our products.
Pro Tip: Logical vs Psychological Solutions
Most people naturally try and solve problems using 
logical
 solutions. But the logical solutions have usually been tried...because they’re logical (it’s what
everyone would try and do).
As a business owners and entrepreneurs I increasingly approach problems to find 
psychological 
solutions, rather than
 logical 
ones. Because if there were
a logical solution, it
 
probably would have already been solved, thereby eliminating the problem. All that’s left are the 
psychological
 problems.
Examples inspired by Rory Sutherland, CMO of Ogilvy Advertising:
“Any fool can sell a product by offering it for a discount, it takes great marketing to sell the same product for a premium”
Logical solution: 
make trains faster to increase satisfaction
Psychological solution: decrease the pain of waiting by adding a dotted map
Psychological solution: 
pay models to be the hostesses on the trip (people would wish it took longer to get to their destination!)
Logical solution:
 make elevator faster
Psychological solution:
 add floor to ceiling mirrors so people are distracted staring at themselves and forget how long they were on the elevator
Logical solution: 
make it cheaper
Psychological solution: 
make fewer of them and raise the price which causes people to want it more.
Often, most logical solutions have been tried and failed. At this point in history, we must give the psychological solutions a shot to solve problems.
As such, as business owners, it is up to us to communicate these value drivers with clarity to increase the prospect’s
perception of these realities. The extent to which you answer these questions in the mind of your prospect will determine the
value you are creating. Only then, will we truly be able to realize the actual value of our product to the marketplace, and by
extension, the egregious prices we want to charge.
It’s difficult to separate the four value drivers from another, as most vehicles combine many of these elements together, but I
will do my best to isolate and clearly explain each below.
