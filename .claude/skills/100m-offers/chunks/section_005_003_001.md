PRICING: CHARGE W HAT IT’S W ORTH
“Charge as high a price as you can say out loud without cracking a smile.”
DAN KENNEDY
A picture of Gym Lords Summit 2019 for our highest level gym owners all sporting my trendy mustache.
January 2019.
ll I could see was black. My eyes felt glued shut. I was awake, but the fatigue in my temples felt like a five-pound
weight was duct-taped to my skull, dragging my eyelids back down. I had to concentrate forcibly to open them.
The details of the dimly lit room beamed in. I rolled over to the edge of the hotel room bed, feeling each and every muscle
in my body as my weight shifted. Hunched on my side, I could see my clothes scattered on the floor. I was so beat the night
before that I didn’t even remember taking them off.
I had just finished a five-day gauntlet of keynote after keynote presentation. Two days of presentations for our highest-level
clients immediately followed by spending two days planning with our entire company (135+ employees).
I had missed a FaceTime call from my father the day before. I didn’t have anything on my agenda for the morning. So I
creakily got up, slid into a hoodie and some sweats, and walked into the hotel hallway to call him back. After the initial
pleasantries, he immediately dove into why he was calling — parental concern.
“I saw the picture you posted of all your clients . . . ” he said, but in an unusually concerned tone. “I thought the event was
for all your highest-paying clients? I didn’t know it was a big event. It looked like you had a thousand people there!”
Alone in the hallway and struggling to shake the heavy weight of exhaustion still, I tried to gauge where his concern was
coming from and what he was getting at. I had explained this all to him already. “It was only for our highest-level clients, that
wasn’t all our clients,” I said. “Just the ones who pay $42,000 a year . . . our Gym Lords, like I told you.”
“Every single person in that picture paid you $42,000?” He sounded almost frightened at the idea.
“Yeah, wild right?” My voice was hoarse from days of speaking and thousands of twenty-second conversations.
“Is it legal what you’re doing?” he asked. 
Wow. That escalated quickly, I thought to myself.
 “Do they know they’re paying
you that much?”

“Yes, it’s legal. And of course they know. It’s not like magically siphoning money.” “That’s a lot of money. I hope what
you’re giving them is worth it.”
I contemplated whether it was worth the effort to dive into this or just ignore it. But knowing this was going to be “a thing,”
I took a deep breath and began to explain. “If I made you $239,000 extra this year, would you pay me $42,000?” I asked, using
“$239,000” because it was the average increase in topline revenue of a gym using our systems for 11 months.
“For sure,” he said, “I mean if I knew I was going to make that back. But what would I have to do?”
“About 15 hours a week of work”
“And how long would it take me to make the $239,000?”
“Eleven months”
“And how much of the $42,000 would I have to pay you up front?”
“Nothing. Just pay me as you start making the money using the system”
I watched it click. My dad got it. “Oh,” he said, “well then, yeah, I would do it.”
“And that's why they do it, too.”
Making shit loads of money breaks people’s minds. It literally stretches their minds so far past what they believe is possible
they assume you are doing something wrong or illegal. They literally “can’t even.”
Why? Because they think to themselves . . . 
they can't be that much smarter than me or work
 
that much harder than me,
so how is it possible for them to make 1,000 times more than me? Enough money that it would take me literally ten lifetimes
to make what they make in a year.
In the three years leading up to me writing this book, I took home over $1,200,000/mo in profit. Every. Single. Month.
That’s more than the compensation for the CEOs of Ford, McDonalds, Motorola, & Yahoo . . . combined . . . every year . . . as
a kid in his twenties.
It angers those who believe life isn't fair. It confuses others who cannot comprehend and believe there must have been a
mistake. And it inspires a select few, who are bound for greatness.
I hope that you are in the last category, because that is who I am writing this for.
You 
can
 do this.
You just need to learn 
how
.
And I'm gonna show you.
Price to Value Discrepancy
“I hope what you’re giving them is worth it.”
Those words would probably sting for most, but when my dad said them to me, I just knew he didn’t understand the 
value
we were providing. What I want to show you is how to create and communicate value, aka the “worth-it-ness” of an offer.
In order to understand how to make a compelling offer, you must understand 
value
. The reason people buy 
anything
 is to
get a 
deal
. They believe what they are getting (VALUE) is worth 
more
 than what they are giving in exchange for it (PRICE).
The moment the value they receive dips below what they are paying, they stop buying from you. This price to value
discrepancy is what you need to avoid at all costs.
After all, as Warren Buffet said, “Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.”

The simplest way to increase the gap between price to value is by lowering the price. It’s also, most of the time, the wrong
decision for the business.
Getting people to buy is NOT the objective of a business. Making money is. And lowering price is a one-way road to
destruction for most — you can only go down to $0, but you can go infinitely high in the other direction. So, unless you have a
revolutionary way of decreasing your costs to 1/10th compared to your competition, don't compete on price.
As Dan Kennedy said, “There is no strategic benefit to being the second cheapest in the marketplace, but there is for being
the most expensive.”
So the goal of our Grand Slam Offer will be to get more people to say yes 
at a higher price
 by increasing our value to
price discrepancy. In other words, we will raise our price only 
after 
we have sufficiently increased our value. This way, they
still get a great deal (think
 
buying $100,000 of value for $10,000). It’s ‘money at a discount.’

Why You Should Charge So Much It Hurts
Most business owners are 
not
 competing on price or value. In fact, they’re not actually competing on anything at all. Their
pricing process typically goes something like this:

1
. 
Look at marketplace
2
. 
See what everyone else offers
3
. 
Take the average
4
. 
Go slightly below to remain “competitive”
5
. 
Provide what their competitors offers with a “little more”
6
. 
End up at a value proposition of “more for less”
And the big secret: those competitors they are copying are dead broke. 
So why on earth
 
copy them?
Pricing where the market is means you’re pricing for market 
efficiency
. Over time, in an efficient marketplace, more
competitors enter offering “a little more for a little less,” until eventually no one can provide any more for any less. At this
point, a market reaches perfect efficiency, and the business owners participating make 
just enough
 at the end of the month to
keep going. The bottom 10-20 percent of operators get washed out or lose the will to fight. Then fresh business owners enter
with no idea and repeat the process of their forefathers. And around and around they go.
In plain words, pricing this way means you are providing a service at just above what it costs for you to stay above water.
We are 
not
 trying to stay barely above water. We are trying to make egregious amounts of money that will have your relatives
asking if what you are doing is legal. Again, we are not trying to get the most customers. 
We are trying to make
 
the most money
.
That being said, since there is no strategic benefit to being the second-lowest priced player in your marketplace. Allow me
to give you a brief overview of why I see premium pricing as not only a very smart business decision, but a moral one.
Furthermore, it’s the only choice that will allow you to truly provide the most value, a unique and strong position in the
marketplace. Let me introduce you to the virtuous cycle of price.
