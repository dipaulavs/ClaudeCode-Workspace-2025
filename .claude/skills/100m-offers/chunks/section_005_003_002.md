# Virtuous Cycle of Price & Premium Price Experience

I have used this framework in most of the materials I release because it needs to be consistently reinforced. The forces of
the marketplace will grate on your belief system. You must stay strong and ignore them! Here’s the basic premise of why you
need
 to charge a premium if you want to best serve your customers.
When you decrease your price, you . . .
. . . Decrease your clients’ emotional investment since it didn’t cost them much
. . . Decrease your clients’ perceived value of your service since it can’t be that good if it’s so cheap, or priced the same as
everyone else
. . . Decrease your clients results because they do not value your service and are not invested
. . . Attract the worst clients who are 
never
 satisfied until your service is 
free
. . . Destroy any margin you have left to be able to actually provide an exceptional experience, hire the best people, invest
in your people, pamper your clients, invest in growth, invest in more locations or more scale, and everything else that you had
hoped in the goal of helping more people solve whatever problem it is that you solve.
In essence, your world sucks. And to make matters worse, your service probably sucks because you are squeezing blood

from the proverbial stone. There’s just not enough money left over to make something exceptional. As a result, you fall in line
with the armies of average businesses that race to the bottom. I’ve lived that life. It’s terrible. If you love your customers and
your employees, please stop short-changing them when there is a better way.
Here’s the reverse. This is what happens when you raise your prices.
When you raise your prices, you . . .
. . . 
Increase
 your clients’ emotional investment
. . . 
Increase
 your clients’ perceived value of your service
. . . 
Increase
 your clients’ results because they value your service and are invested
. . . Attract the 
best
 clients who are 
the easiest
 to satisfy and actually cost 
less
 to fulfill, and who are the most likely to
actually receive and perceive the most relative value
. . . 
Multiply
 your margin because you have money to 
invest
 in systems to create efficiency; smart people; improved
customer experience; scale your business; and, most importantly of all, to keep watching the number in your personal bank
account go up, month after month, even with reinvesting in your business. This allows you to ultimately enjoy the process for
the long haul and help more people as you grow, rather than burning out and shriveling into obscurity.
To swing the argument even further in favor of higher prices, here are a few interesting concepts. When you raise your
price, you increase the value the consumer receives without changing anything else about your product. Wait, what? Yes.
Higher Price Means Higher Value (Literally)
In a blind taste test, researchers asked consumers to rate three wines: a low-priced wine, a medium-priced wine and an
expensive wine. Throughout the study, the participants rated the wines with the prices visible. They rated them, unsurprisingly,
in order of their price, with the most expensive being the “best,” the second most expensive being “second best,” and the third,
cheapest option, being rated as “cheap wine.”
What the tasters didn’t know is that the researchers gave them the exact same wine all three times. Yet, the tasters reported
a wide discrepancy between the “high priced” wine and the “cheap” wine. This has deep implications for the direct
relationship between value and price.
In essence, raising your prices can directly enhance the value you provide. What’s more, the higher the price, the more
allure your product or service has. People 
want
 to buy expensive things. They just need a reason. And the goal isn’t just to be
slightly above the market price — 
the goal is to be so much higher that a consumer thinks to themselves,
 
“This is so much more
expensive, there must be something entirely different going on here.”
That is how you create a category of one. In this new perceived marketplace, you are a monopoly and can make monopoly
profits. That is the point.
One final point I want to drive home: if you offer a service where a customer must do something in order to achieve the
result, or solve the problem you say you solve, they must be invested. The more invested they are, the more likely they are to
achieve the positive result. Therefore, it follows that if you care about your customers, you should get them as invested as
humanly possible. Ideally, this means pricing your services or product in such a way that it 
stings
 a little when they buy. That
sting will force and focus their attention and their investment in your product or service. Those who pay the most, pay the most
attention. And if your customers are more adherent and follow through, and if they achieve better results with your service than
your competition, then you are in a very real way providing more value than anyone else. This is how you win.
But I know this isn’t easy, and it shouldn’t be. Your product must 
deliver
. So many wish to shortcut the real work. Do that
and you 
will
 fail. In the real world, to have the “gonads” to charge big ticket prices, you must 
outwork your self doubt
. You
must be so confident in your delivery, because you have done it 
so many times,
 that you 
know
 that this person will succeed.
Experience is what gives you the conviction to ask for someone’s entire year’s salary as payment. You must believe so deeply
in your solution that when you look at yourself in the mirror at night, alone, your conviction remains unshakable. So let me
bring this section home with my personal experience.
My Premium Price Experience
In my first niche consulting business — Gym Launch — I teach gym owners a better business model. Before productizing
my consulting services, I flew out to 33 gyms in 18 months to do full turnarounds.

We would fly out, fix everything in the gym, and relaunch it in 21 days. We would average an increase in $42,000 in
additional sales in 21 days. It was wild. My fee was the 100% of the revenue I would bring in.
At our peak, we were turning around eight gyms a month. This quickly became a logistical nightmare. After the wear and
tear of living in motels month after month after month, I thought to myself 
there has to be a better way to do this.
One month, there was a gym we were scheduled to go fly out to. But, I simply didn’t want to do it. So I told them we were
going to cancel the engagement. The gym owner practically threatened me to help him. So I said I would help him, but he would
have to do all the work, but I would show him how.
Within thirty days, this gym had made almost $44,000 in new up front cash collected sales (4x their previous month). As
soon as I saw that my process could be duplicated from afar, without me having to fly people in. . .our business exploded. I had
found the missing link because my travel schedule was no longer a constraint. We went on to sell 4000+ more gyms over the
next few years (and counting) using a 
done-with-you
 rather than a 
done-for-you
 model. But. . .back to premium pricing.
When I entered the space, low-price competitors offered full-service marketing for $500 per month, with a single high-
price competitor charging $5,000 for his product.
I wanted to be the premium price leader. I wanted to be so expensive that it created allure around what we were doing. So,
we came in at three-times the highest-priced player and 32 times more than the lower-priced players. A price of $16,000 for a
16-week, done-with-you intensive. Then we upsold 35 percent of those people into a three-year, $42,000/year agreement for us
to help them grow their gyms.
For context: The average gym owner makes $35,280/year in take-home profits. If that’s the average, it means 
half
 make
even 
less
 than that. So for many of them, they were committing to 
half
 of their yearly pay 
or more
 to buy our program. And I
was selling this to grown men as a kid in his twenties, telling them I was going to help them make more money. This was
possible because my conviction was stronger than their skepticism. 
How?
Based a voluntary survey taken at our last full company event, with 158 gyms responding, we found that a Gym Launch gym
who has been in our program for 11 months will experience the following average improvements:
Top Line Revenue Growth:
 +$19,932/mo (+$239,000/yr)
Recurring Revenue Growth: 
+$13,339/mo (+$160,068/yr)
Bottom Line Growth (Profit):
 From $2,943/mo to $8,940/mo (3.1x!)
Client Growth: 
+67
Churn (% of clients who leave each month): 
From 10.7 percent to 6.8 percent
Retail Sales:
 +$4,400/mo in retail product sales revenue
Prices: 
From $129/mo to $167/mo
The survey just proved what I already knew. I had complete conviction in our product.
I knew it worked. I had 
outworked my self-doubt.
Summary Points
What should you take from this?
First and foremost, charge a premium. It will allow you to do things no one else can to make your clients successful. We
were able to charge a premium because we provided more value than anyone else in the industry. In a real way, we were
charging on a 
fraction
 of what our clients made using our system. This is important. 
Our clients still got a
 
deal
. The gap
between what they paid (price) and what they got (value) was massive. As a result, the virtuous cycle continued to spin. We
charged the most money. We provided the most value.
Our gyms remained the most competitive, made the most money, always had the latest and best acquisition systems, and had
the support to implement them at lightning speed.
We made many mistakes along the way, but our pricing model was not one of them. It allowed me the room to make big bets
without losing the farm. The truth is that 99 percent of businesses need to raise their prices to grow, not lower them. Profit is
oxygen. It fuels the fire of growth. You need it if you want to reach more people and make a bigger impact.

In order to charge so much, though, you must learn to create tremendous value. Let’s head there next.
