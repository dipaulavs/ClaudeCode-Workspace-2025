# Commit to the Niche & Riches in Niches

**Path:** Section II: Pricing/Chapter 4: Pricing: Finding The Right Market - A Starving Crowd/Commit to the Niche & Riches in Niches
**Type:** subsection

---

I have a saying when coaching entrepreneurs on picking their target market 
“Don’t make
 
me niche slap you.”
Too often, a newer entrepreneur half-heartedly tries 
one
 offer in 
one
 market, doesn't make a million dollars, then
mistakenly thinks “this is a bad market.” Most times that’s not actually the case. They just haven’t found a Grand Slam Offer yet
to apply to that market.
They think, 
I’ll switch from helping dentists to helping chiropractors
 — 
that’s it!
 When, in reality, both of those are
normal markets and represent billions of dollars in revenue. Either would work, j
ust not both
. You must pick 
one
. No one can
serve two masters.
I have coined the term “niche slap” to remind entrepreneurs in my communities to commit once they pick. All businesses
and, all markets, have unpleasant characteristics. The grass is never greener once you get to the other side. If you keep hopping
from niche to niche, hoping that the market will solve your problems, you deserve to be 
niche slapped.
You must stick with whatever you pick long enough to have trial and error. You will fail. In fact, you will fail until you
succeed. But you will fail far longer if you keep changing who you market to, because you must start over from the beginning
each time. So, pick then commit.
Riches Are In The Niches
The other reason to commit to the niche is because of how much more you will make.
Simply put, niching down will make you far more money.
Author Note - When To Broaden (Advice For Most People)
For most, if you are under $10M per year, niching down will make you more money. After that, it will depend on how narrow the niche is, or, what is
called TAM (total addressable market). A business can really only grow to meet the total addressable market. That being said, for most people, getting to
$10M per year is already a top .4% achievement (only 1 in 250 businesses achieve this). So for 99.6 percent of readers below $10M per year, it’s almost
always easier to serve 
fewer
 clients 
more narrowly
. But if you want to go beyond that, you
 
may
 
(depending on the size of
 
your TAM) have to broaden
your audience by going up market, down market, or into an adjacent market where your existing services can provide value.
For context, many companies expanded to $30M+ per year serving a single niche: Chiropractors, Gyms, Plumbers, Solar, Roofers, Salon Owners, etc. If
you are at $1M or $3M, thinking you have capped and must expand, you are wrong. You just need to be better.
When I truly grasped how much more 
profit
 I was leaving on the table, it changed my life. It was what took me from doing
acquisition for 
anyone
 to teaching it to a specific avatar. In my instance, I decided on a microgym owner with ~100 members, a
signed lease, at least one employee, and wanted to help clients lose weight. That’s pretty specific compared to “small business
owners” or “anyone who will pay me” which is common. And I was very specific. In that business (Gym Launch) - we turned
down - and still do - anyone who is 
not
 that avatar. That means no personal trainers, no online coaches, etc.
Could I have helped them? Of course I could have. I mean heck, the majority of our portfolio is comprised of non-gym
companies. But in order to maintain product focus, and high converting messaging, knowing 
exactly
 who the product was for
was a game changer.
It helped us know 
exactly
 who we were speaking to at all times. And 
exactly
 whose problems we were solving.
But simplicity and ease may not be enough to sway you, so let me illustrate why honing in on 
one niche will make you more
money
.
Reason
: you can literally charge 100x more for the
 
exact
 
same product. Dan Kennedy
 
was the first person to illustrate this
for me, and I will do my best to pass on the torch to you in these pages.

Niching Product Pricing Example:
Example
Dan Kennedy taught me this (and it changed my life forever). Let’s say you sold a generic course on Time Management.
Unless you were some massive time management guru with a compelling or unique story, it would be unlikely it would turn into
anything significant. What do you think “yet another” time management course is valued at? $19, $29? Sure. Nothing to write
home about. Let’s just say $19 for illustration sake.
**Now we shall unleash the power of niche pricing in various stages on your product**
So let’s imagine you make the product more specific, keeping the same principles, and call it “Time Management For Sales
Professionals.” All of a sudden, this course is for a more specific type of person. We could tie their increase to even one more
sale or one more deal and it would be worth more. But there are a lot of sales people. So this might be a $99 product. Neat, but
we can do better.
So let’s go down another level of niching and call our product…. “Time Management for B2B Outbound Sales Reps.”
Following the same principles of specificity, now we know our sales people probably have very experienced deals and
commissions. A single sale would easily net this salesman $500 (or more), so it would be easy to justify a $499 price tag. This
is already a 25x increase in price for almost an identical product. I could stop here, but I’m going to go one step further.
Let’s just niche down one last level…. “Time Management for B2B Outbound Power Tools & Gardening Sales Reps.”
Boom.
Think about it for a second, if you were a power tools outbound sales rep, you would think to yourself “This is made
exactly for me” and would 
happily
 fork over maybe $1000 to $2000 for a time management program that could help you
achieve your goal.
The actual pieces of the program may be the same as the generic $19 course, but since they have been applied, and the
sales messaging could speak so much to this avatar, they will find it more compelling 
and
 get more value from it in a real way.
This concept applies to anything you decide to do. You want to be ‘the guy’ who services ‘this type of person’ or solves ‘this
type of problem.’ And even more niched ‘I solve this type of problem for this specific type of person in this unique counter-
intuitive way that reverses their deepest fear.”
That’s why a fitness program for generic weight loss might be priced at only $19 while a fitness program designed and
marketed only to shift-nurses might be priced at $1997….(even though the core of the program is likely similar - eat less, move
more).
End Result: The market matters. Your niche matters. And if you can sell the same product for 100x the price, should you?

I’ll let you decide.
Summary Points
The purpose of this chapter is to reinforce two things. First, don't pick a 
bad
 market. Normal markets are fine. Great
markets are great. Second, once you pick, commit to it until you figure it out.
If you try 
one hundred offers
, 
I promise
 you will succeed. Most people never try anything. Others fail once, then give up. It
takes resilience to succeed. Stop personalizing! It’s not about you! If your offer doesn’t work, it doesn’t mean you suck. It
means your offer sucks. Big difference. You only suck if you stop trying. So, try again. You’ll never become world class if you
stop after a failed attempt.
If you find a crazy good market, ride it, and ride it hard. And if you pair a Grand Slam Offer with a crazy market, you’ll
likely never need to work again (seriously). So have this skill set — the ability to accurately assess markets by taking into
account pain, money, targeting, and growth — in your back pocket so that when lightning strikes, you can make sure it strikes
twice.
Having established how to nail a market, let’s get back to pricing. The first step to making crazy money is charging
premium prices.
