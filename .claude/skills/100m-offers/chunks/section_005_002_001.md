PRICING: FINDING THE RIGHT MARKET -- A STARVING CROW D
“The seed that fell on good soil represents those who truly hear and understand God’s word and produce a harvest of thirty, sixty, or even a
hundred times as much as had been planted!”
MATTHEW  13:23 (NLT)
marketing professor asked his students, “If you were going to open a hotdog stand, and you could only have 
one
advantage over your competitors . . . which would it be . . . ?”
“Location! ….Quality! …. Low prices! ….Best taste!”
The students kept going until eventually they had run out of answers. They looked at each other waiting for the professor to
speak. The room finally fell quiet.
The professor smiled and replied, “
A starving crowd.”
You could have the worst hot dogs, terrible prices, and be in a terrible location, but if you’re the only hot dog stand in town
and the local college football game breaks out, you’re going to sell out. That’s the value of a starving crowd.
At the end of the day, if there is a ton of demand for a solution, you can be mediocre at business, have a terrible offer, and
have no ability to persuade people, and you can 
still
 make money.
An example of this was the toilet paper shortage at the beginning of Covid-19. There was no offer. The pricing was
atrocious. And there was no compelling sales pitch. But because the crowd was so big and so starving, rolls of toilet paper
were going for $100 or more. That’s the value of a starving crowd.
Selling Newspapers
A good friend of mine, Lloyd, owned a software business that served newspapers for almost a decade. They set up digital
ad services on newspaper websites with a few clicks and instantly helped them sell a whole new ad product. He only charged
them a percentage of the revenue he added. So if they made nothing, neither did he. It was pure gain for the papers and a great
offer.
But, despite having a great offer and natural sales ability, his business began to decline. Being a high-achieving
entrepreneur, he tried all the different angles to solve the problem — 
but nothing worked
. He couldn't figure out what the issue
was. It was hard for me to see him struggle with this because I think Lloyd is much smarter than I am, and the answer seemed
obvious to me. But watching him go through this has been a lesson I have taken with me for life. Before I reveal it, what do you

think the problem was? Product? Offer? Marketing and sales? His team?
Let’s break it down. It wasn’t his product — that was great. It wasn’t his offer — he had a zero risk revshare model. It
wasn’t his sales skills — he was a natural salesman. So, then what was the problem? 
He was selling to newspapers!
 His
market was shrinking by 25 percent 
every year
! He had looked at all the angles, except for the most obvious one. Finally, after
years of fighting an uphill battle in his market, he realized his market was the source of his problems and decided to downsize
his company.
Don’t worry — this story has a second half. To illustrate the power of a market, as soon as COVID hit, Lloyd pivoted. He
started an automated mask manufacturing company. With new technology, he brought the cost per mask below what people
could buy them for from China. Within five months he was doing 
millions per month
. Same entrepreneur. Different market. He
applied his 
same
 skill set to a business 
he had zero experience in
 and was able to win. That’s the power of picking the right
market.
I give you that story as a cautionary tale. 
Your market matters.
 Lloyd is a 
very
 smart human. He is obviously very capable.
But we can all be blinded as entrepreneurs because we don't like to give up. We are so accustomed to solving impossible
problems that we will keep ramming our heads into the wall. We hate quitting. But the reality is that everyone is affected by
their market.
So how do you pick the right market?
What To Look For
There is a market in desperate need of your abilities. You need to find it. And when you do, you will capitalize, all while
wondering what took you so long. Don’t be romantic about your audience. Serve the people who can pay you what you’re
worth. And remember that picking a market, like anything, is always our choice, so choose wisely.
In order to sell anything, you need demand. We are not trying to 
create
 demand. We are trying to 
channel
 it. That is a very
important distinction. If you don’t have a market for your offer, nothing that follows will work. This entire book sits atop the
assumption that you have at least a “normal” market, which I define as a market that is growing at the same rate as the
marketplace and that has common unmet needs that fall into one of three categories: improved health, increased wealth, or
improved relationships. For example Lloyd, from the above newspaper story, could have gone through this entire book and
nothing in here would have worked for him. Why? Because he would be targeting newspapers, a dying market.
That being said, having a great market is an advantage. 
But you can be in a normal
 
market that’s growing at an average rate
and still make crazy money
. Every market I have been in has been a normal market. You just don't 
actually
 want to be selling
ice to eskimos.
Here are the basic tenets of what I look for in markets. Let’s run through them before we return to the offer.
When picking markets, I look for four indicators:
1) Massive Pain
They must not want, but desperately need, what I am offering. Pain can be anything that frustrates people about their lives.
Being broke is painful. A bad marriage is painful. Waiting in line at the grocery stores is painful. Back pain . . . ugly smile pain
. . . overweight pain . . . Humans suffer a lot. So for us entrepreneurs, endless opportunity abounds.

The degree of the pain will be proportional to the price you will be able to charge (more on this in the Value Equation
chapter). When they hear the solution to their pain, and inversely, what their life would look like 
without
 this pain, they should
be drawn to your solution.
I have a saying I use to train sales teams 
“The pain is the pitch.”
 If you can articulate the pain a prospect is feeling
accurately, they will almost always buy what you are offering. A prospect must have a painful problem for us to solve and
charge money for our solution.
Pro Tip
The point of good writing is for the reader to 
understand
.
The point of good persuasion is for the prospect to feel 
understood.
2) Purchasing Power
A friend of mine had a very good system for helping people improve their resumes to get more job interviews. He was
great at it. But try as he did, he just could not get people to pay for his services. Why? Because they were all unemployed!
This, again, may seem obvious. But he thought, 
“These people are easy to target. They’re in
 
massive pain. There are
plenty of them, and it's constantly adding new people. This is a great market!”
He just forgot a crucial point: your audience needs to be able to afford the service you’re charging them for. Make sure
your targets have the money, or access to the amount of money, needed to buy your services at the prices you require to make it
worth your time.
3) Easy to Target
Let’s say you have a perfect market, but no way of finding the people who comprise it. Well, making a Grand Slam Offer
will be difficult. I make my life easier by looking for easy-to-target markets. Examples of this are avatars that have
associations they belong to, mailing lists, social media groups, channels they all watch, etc. If our potential customers are all
gathered together somewhere, then we can market to them. If searching them out, however, is like finding needles in a haystack,
then it can be very difficult to get your offer in front of any potentially interested eyes.
This point is tactical. It is reality, not theoretical. For instance, you may 
want
 to serve rich doctors. But if your ads are
being displayed to nursing students, your offer will fall on deaf ears, no matter how good it is. Main point: you want to make
sure you can target your ideal audience easily. 
(Clarifying point - there is no issue wanting to serve rich doctors, they are
easy to
 
find. This is just illustrative that your promotions must be served to the right audience).
4) Growing
Growing markets are like a tailwind. They make everything move forward faster. Declining markers are like headwinds.
They make all efforts harder. This was Lloyd's example. Newspapers had three of the four makings of a great market: (1) lots
of pain, (2) purchasing power, (3) easy to target. But they were shrinking (fast). No matter how hard he tried, the entire
marketplace was fighting against him. Business is hard enough, and markets move quickly. So you might as well find a good
market to give you a tailwind to make the process easier.
Making This Real

There are three main markets that will always exist: Health, Wealth, and Relationships. The reason that those will always
exist is that there is always tremendous pain when you lack them. There is always demand for solutions to these core human
pains. The goal is to find a smaller subgroup within one of those larger buckets that is growing, has the buying power, and is
easy to target (the other three variables).
So if I were a relationship expert trying to find my avatar, I’d rather focus on “second half of life relationship” coaching for
old timers than helping college students in relationships. Why? Because senior citizens who are alone are likely suffering more
pain as they are nearer their deaths (pain), have more buying power (money), and are easy to find (targeting). Lastly, at the time
of this writing, there are more people turning 65 each year than turning 20 (growing).
That is the idea. Think about what you are good at in regards to health, wealth, and relationships. Then think about who
might value your service the most (is in the most pain), has the buying power to pay what 
you
 want (money), and can be found
easily (targeting). As long as those three criteria are strong 
and
 the market isn't shrinking, you’ll be in good shape.
But how important to your success is finding a “great market” versus a “normal market” versus a “bad market?” The
answer: it actually depends. Let me explain.
Order of Importance: Three Levers on Success
It’s unlikely you are going to be in a dying market like the newspaper example. It’s also unlikely you’re going to be selling
toilet paper in COVID (buying frenzy). You’ll likely be in a “normal” market. And that’s totally okay. There is a fortune to be
made within normal markets. My single point here is that you can't be in a “bad” market, or nothing will work. That being said,
here’s the simplest illustration of the order of importance between markets, offers, and persuasion skills:
Starving Crowd (market) > Offer Strength > Persuasion Skills
Let’s say you were to rate these elements on a scale of great, normal, and bad. You could essentially move down the line
from left to right in order of importance. A “great” rating on a higher-order piece overpowers anything else lower on the
priority scale. A “normal” rating moves the buck to the next part of the equation. A “bad” stops the equation 
unless
 a “great”
from a higher priority component nullifies it. Here are a few examples:
Example #1:
 Even if you have a bad offer and are bad at persuasion, you’re going to make money if you’re in a great
market. If you’re on the corner hocking hot dogs when the bars close up at 2am, with mobs of starving drunk folks, you’re
gonna sell out your hotdogs.
Example #2 (most of us):
 If you are in a normal market and have a Grand Slam Offer (great), you can make tons of money

even if you’re bad at persuasion. This is most people reading this book. That’s why I wrote it — to help you maximize your
success by learning to really build a Grand Slam Offer.
Example #3
: Let’s say you’re in a normal market and have a normal offer. In order to be massively successful, you would
have
 to be 
exceptionally
 good at persuasion. Then and only then will you succeed, with your persuasive skills serving as the
fulcrum of your success. Heck, many empires have been built by exceptional persuaders. It’s just the hardest path to follow and
requires the most effort and learning. Nailing your offer helps you shortcut this path to success. Otherwise, you will just have a
normal business that takes exceptional skill to be successful (nothing wrong with that, but probably not what you signed up for).
