People have deep, unchanging desires. This is what marriages are lost over, wars are fought over, and people will
willingly die for. Our goal is not to create desire. It’s simply to channel that desire through our offer and monetization vehicle.
The dream outcome is the expression of the feelings and experiences the prospect has envisioned in their mind. It’s the gap
between their current reality and their dreams. Our goal is to accurately depict that dream back to them, so they feel
understood, and explain how our vehicle will get them there.
The dream outcome is simple; it’s the “getting there” where the value gets enhanced or detracted.
People generally, and our clients specifically, want:
. . . To be perceived as beautiful
. . . To be respected
. . . To be perceived as powerful
. . . To be loved
. . . To increase their 
status
These are all powerful drivers.
But multiple vehicles may accomplish the same thing. Take the desire 
“to be perceived as
 
beautiful” 
for example, here are
a lot of things that touch on this desire:
Make Up
Anti-aging creams/serums
Supplements
Shapewear
Plastic Surgery
Fitness
→ All these vehicles channel the desire to be perceived as beautiful.
And if we further unpack the idea of a desire to be beautiful, we see that it may be a surface-level declaration of a deeper
desire to achieve higher status in one’s social group.
The dream outcome value driver is most prominently used when comparing the relative value 
between two different
desires being satisfied
. In general, the dream outcome that most directly increases a prospect’s status will be the one they
value most. As such, a prospect may value that entire category of vehicles that satisfy one desire more than another category
that satisfies a different desire. For many men, making money is more important than being handsome. Why? Because money
drives status for men more than being handsome does. So, in general, they will value all offers that make them money more than
offers that help them look good.
I once heard Russell Brunson tell a story about this concept. He explained how his wife, Collette, at first hearing about this
status concept, rejected it. She claimed she wasn’t driven by status and would never want to drive a Lamborghini. Instead, she
favored her minivan. But, after talking further, she revealed it was because driving a Lamborghini would decrease her status
amongst her mom friends, while driving a minivan would show she was a good mother (increase in status). So it’s not about the
money, it's about the 
status (the perceived
 
increase or decrease in relative standing when compared to others socially or
professionally)
. Talk in terms
 
of things your prospect believes will increase their status, and you will have your prospects
drooling.
Pro Tip: Frame benefits in terms of status gained 
from the viewpoint of
 
others
When writing copy, you can make it that much more powerful by talking about how 
other people
 will perceive the prospect’s achievement. Connect

the dots for them. Example: If you buy this golf club, your drive will increase by 40 yards
.
 Your golf buddies' jaws will drop when they see your ball soar 40
yards past theirs . . . they’ll ask you what’s changed . . . only you will know.
That being said, when comparing two products or services that satisfy the 
same
 desire, the value from the dream outcomes
will cancel out (since they are the same). It will be the other three variables that drive the difference in perceived value, and
ultimately price. For example, if we have two products or services that both help make someone beautiful, it will be the
likelihood of achievement, time delay, and effort required that will differentiate the perceived value of each offer.
Simply put: if two things make someone beautiful, what makes one worth $50,000 and another $5? Answer: The extent of
the other three value variables.
#2 Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (Goal = Increase)
This was the last of the variables I added when trying to think through this framework a few years ago. I just felt like
something was missing with only the other three.
Then I realized people pay for certainty. They value certainty. I call this “the perceived likelihood of achievement.” In
other words, “How likely do I believe it is that I will achieve the result I am looking for if I make this purchase?”
For example, how much would you pay to be a plastic surgeon’s 10,000th patient versus their first?
If you're a normal, sane person, a lot more. I mean heck, you might even ask them to pay you if you are their first patient
ever.
So you can see even from this simple example that while the service you are receiving is technically the same, the only
thing that changes is your perceived likelihood of getting what you want.
Both surgeons take the same amount of time to do the surgery (if anything, the guy who has done it 10,000 times would
likely get it done faster and 
still
 charge 
more
). The more-experienced surgeon has a track record of achieving a result, which
incentivizes their desirability.
People value this perceived likelihood of achievement. Increasing a prospect’s conviction that your offer will “actually”
work for them, will make your offer that much more valuable even though the work remains the same on your end. So to
increase value with all offers, we must communicate perceived likelihood of achievement through our messaging, proof, what
we choose to include or exclude in our offer, and our guarantees (more on these later).
