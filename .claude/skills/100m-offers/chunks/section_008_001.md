# Your First $100,000

**Path:** Section V: Execution/Your First $100,000

“The first $100,000 is a bitch, but you gotta do it. I don't care what you have to do—if it means walking everywhere and not eating anything that
wasn't purchased with a coupon, find a way to get your hands on $100,000. After that, you can ease off the gas a little bit.”
CHARLIE MUNGER, VICE CHAIRMAN BERKSHIRE HATHAW AY
March 2017.
My heart was racing. I could literally feel each beat pounding in my chest. I clenched my jaw to fend off the knot in my throat
that I knew would lead to tears. I wanted to give in. Years of emotions were bottled below the surface.
Years of ignoring my reality and lack of success. Years of putting off how I felt just focusing on 
moving forward
. The
pressure was shooting to the surface. I could 
feel
 it.
“We did it,” I said.
Leila, my wife now, looked up at me. She was in the kitchen making dinner and stopped, spatula in hand. “What do you
mean?”
“We did it. We hit $100k.” I could barely get the words out because I didn’t want the tears to break through the tremble in
my voice.
“Like revenue?”
“No. Like in our personal bank accounts.”
“Holy shit really?! That’s amazing!!”
She ran over to me, disregarding the food on the stove, and wrapped her arms around my neck, spatula still in hand.
“I’m so proud of you”
She squeezed me. I slumped into her arms. It was like every knot in my body that I had been holding onto melted all at once.
I could barely contain myself. But when I think back to it, the feeling I had wasn’t happiness. It was relief. I’d moved from fear
to security. I’d traded feeling like a failure everyday, watching my work and effort yield nothing, to realizing a dream. The
constant anxiety and fear of “what are we gonna do” 
finally
 be replaced by something else. I finally had time to let myself feel
something.
I felt like this “struggle” chapter of life was finally over.
“Look,” I said. “It’s for real”
I nuzzled my head out of Leila’s arms. I didn't want to look her in the eyes because I knew it would put me over the edge. I
pulled my phone out and put it between us. We both stared at the unmoving screen with our personal bank account balance.
$101,018
Our gazes remained unbroken as they confirmed a new, shared reality. It wasn’t an illusion. It wasn’t revenue. It wasn’t
“profit” that was still in the business account, only to be taken out later by some unforeseen emergency. It wasn’t “earmarked”
money that had to be used to pay off some debt. It was 
ours
. For real.
“Babe,” I said. “We could fuck up and not make another dollar for three straight years, and still be okay.”
At the time, $33,000 per year was more than enough for us to live at our current expenses for three years 
and some
.
Years of ups and downs. Years of ploughing money into my business(es) only to watch it vanish in overhead, payroll, and
mistakes. Years of seminars, courses, workshops, coaching programs, masterminds . . . had F-I-N-A-L-L-Y turned into wealth.
It felt like I had broken into a new plane. The relative increase in wealth was more than I ever felt.
Tens of millions of dollars in the bank later, it was, and still is, the richest I have ever felt in my life. It was the beginning of
the next chapter in my life as a business person and entrepreneur.
Some people get there fast. Some people get there slowly. But everyone gets there eventually, as long as you don’t give up.
Keep moving forward. Keep getting up. Keep believing it can happen.

And, it will.

You now have a valuable, high margin, de-commoditized grand slam offer. This is the first building block of a wonderful
business — a product or service that people desperately want and truly solves their problem. For many, this will be enough to
make far more sales, at higher prices, with more profit. Your first true grand slam offer should be able to get you to your first
$100,000. For others, you will still want 
more
. Which is 100 percent your right as a capitalist.
There’s so much more to building an acquisition machine 
profitably
. I could not cover it all in one book. Out of respect for
you, I wanted to make this thorough but manageable. That being said, the next book is dedicated to exactly that — 
getting more
— through generating leads. In that book, I will break down 
exactly
 how to acquire customers 
at a profit
. Meaning, if you
structure your promotions correctly, you should never have to pay for a new customer again. That is the subject of
