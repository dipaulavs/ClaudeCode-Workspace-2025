# Unconditional & Conditional Guarantees (Part 1)

**Path:** Section IV: Enhancing Your Offer/Chapter 15: Enhancing The Offer: Guarantees/Unconditional & Conditional Guarantees (Part 1)
**Type:** subsection

---

What the Client Gets
: 
A) a full refund, B) a 50 percent refund, C) a refund of their ad
 
spend and any ancillary costs
incurred, D) you pay for a competitors program instead, E) you return their money plus an additional $1,000 (or other
applicable amount)
My Take:
 
This is about as simple as it gets. It’s also very risky. You put yourself in a
 
situation where if someone does not
achieve the results, whether because of your fault or not, you will still be held accountable. Obviously this is a strong, but
unoriginal guarantee. You can add conditions, but the more conditions you add, the faster this guarantee loses its teeth.
Wording
: 
I heard Jason Fladlien, who I referenced earlier, pitch his unconditional
 
guarantee on a webinar and I thought it
was unbelievable. These are 100% his words and not my own. I take no credit for this but have included it for completeness.
“I’m not asking you to decide yes or no today...I'm asking you to make a fully informed decision, that is all. The only
way you can make a fully informed decision is on the inside, not the outside. So you get on the inside and see if everything
we say on this webinar is true and valuable to you. Then, if it is, that’s when you decide to keep it. If it’s not for you, no
hard feelings. You will then, after signing up at URL be able to make a fully informed decision that this isn’t for you. But
you can’t make this decision right now for the same reason you don't buy a house without first looking at the inside of it.
And know this...whether it’s 29 min or 29 days from now...if you ain’t happy, I ain’t happy. For any reason whatsoever, if you
want your money back you can get it because I only want to keep your money if you’re happy. All you have to do is go to
support@xyz.com 
and tell use “gimme my money” and you got it, and in short order - our response times to any support
request average 61min over a 24/7 time period. You can only make such a guarantee when you're confident that what you
have is the real deal and I'm fairly confident that when you sign up at URL you’re getting exactly what you need to
BENEFIT.”
Pro Tip: Name Your Guarantee Something Cool
If you are going to give a guarantee, spice it up. Instead of using “satisfaction” or some other “vanilla” word, describe it more strongly.
Generic Example
 
(Bad): 30 Day Money Back Satisfaction Guarantee.
Creative Imagery Example #1
 
(Good): In 30 days, if you wouldn’t jump into shark
 
infested waters to get our product back, we will return every
dollar you paid.
Creative Imagery Example #2
 
(Great): You’ll get our famous “Club a Baby Seal
 
Guarantee”After 30 days of using our services, if you wouldn’t club
a baby seal to stay on as a customer, you don’t have to pay a penny.
[Unconditional] Satisfaction-Based Refund Guarantee (Expanded from above):
What the Client Gets:
 
If at any time they're not satisfied with the level of service they're
 
receiving from you, they can
request a refund (at any time) for the program.
My Take:
 
Believe it or not, this was my guarantee when I sold weight-loss programs.
 
Besides being an irresistible offer, I
guaranteed satisfaction. I used the strength of my guarantee to close a lot of deals. “Do you think I'd still be in business if I gave
a crazy guarantee like that and wasn't good at what I did? Now I'm 
not
 guaranteeing you’re going to hit this goal in six weeks,
after all, because I can't eat the food for you. But I am guaranteeing that you will get $500 worth of value and service from us to

support you. If you don't feel like we gave you that level of service, I’ll write you a check the day you tell me we suck.”
It works perfectly with a best-case/worst-case close. “Best case you get the body of your dreams and we give you all your
money towards staying with us to hit your long-term goal. Worst case you tell me I suck, I write you a check, and you get six
weeks of free training. Both options are risk free. But, the only thing guaranteed 
not
 to help you is walking out of here today.” If
you are good at what you do, you can use a guarantee like this to push a lot of people over the edge. That line made me a lot of
money. I had two people take me up on it out of 4,000 sales in three and a half years.
Satisfaction/No questions asked is the highest form of guarantee. It means we could do everything right and you could still
ask for your money back. As long as you know the math, you will typically make up for the refunds in spaces with higher and
faster closing on the sales side. 
But you have to be good at fulfilling your promises.
 If not, steer clear. I believe this offer
works much better in lower-ticket situations. It becomes very risky as you go into higher-ticket services with higher costs of
fulfillment.
Pro Tip: Unconditional vs Conditional Based on Business Type
Bigger broader guarantees work better with lower ticket B2C businesses (many people just won't bother taking the time). The higher the ticket, and the
more business oriented it is, the more you want to steer towards specific guarantees. That may or may not include refunds, and may or may not have
conditions.
[Conditional] Outsized Refund Guarantee
What the Client Gets:
 
Double or Triple their money back, or a no-strings-attached
 
payment of $X,XXX (or another
amount that’s far more than what they paid).
My Take:
 
This is for when you sell something with high margins. And this is a guarantee
 
to add 
with
 a consumption
condition. That means they must do a variety of things to qualify for this guarantee. A world class affiliate marketer Jason
Fladlien (who did $27M in a single day) recently used an amazing guarantee for a course he sold. He said “if you buy this
course and spend $X on advertising your ecommerce store using the methods herein, and don't make money, I will buy your
store from you for $25,000 no questions asked.” He claimed that an additional $3M in sales came from this crazy guarantee on
a $2997 course. What’s more, he only gave 10 of these $25,000 refunds out. So the refund generated $2.75M in extra sales.
That’s what a crazy guarantee does for you.
In general, a very strong guarantee like this will definitely drive more sales. This really serves the purpose when you need
a 
lot
 of stuff to be done by your prospect, and, assuming those things are done, there’s a low chance of the result not being
achieved. Sometimes a guarantee like this can actually get clients better results on top. This guarantee will typically outperform
a traditional 30-day money back guarantee in terms of net conversions (sales minus refunds).
[Conditional] Service Guarantee
What the Client Gets:
 
You keep working for them free of charge until X is achieved.
My Take:
 
This is probably my personal favorite guarantee of all time. It essentially
 
guarantees they will achieve their
goal, but it eliminates the element of time. You are never at risk for losing the money. The guarantee is around the outcome. To
add further flavor to it, you can make this guarantee conditional on them doing key actions linked with success: setting up a
web page, attending calls, showing up to workouts, weighing in, reporting data, etc.
Real Talk: Since I have been advising businesses to use this particular guarantee, I have yet to have a single person say a
client took them up on it. Realistically, if someone actually does everything you asked them to do and doesn’t achieve the result
by the time you had said, one of two things usually happens:
1
. 
Seeing your client’s commitment, you happily keep working with them until they achieve the desired result
2
. 
It gets dropped. Your client is likely very close to the goal, which means satisfied.

Also, it’s likely the sales conversation with the guarantee was months earlier. What may have been important in the sales
conversation is a distant memory now, replaced by their affection towards you/your business.
[Conditional] Modified Service Guarantee
What the Client Gets:
 
You give them another Y-long period of service or access to your
 
product/services free of charge.
Generally, Y should give them at least twice the duration.
My Take:
 
This is like the service guarantee, but it ties a specific duration to your extended
 
work/involvement. So instead
of being on the hook “forever,” you’re only on the hook for an additional Y period of time. I’ve seen it work magically and
keep the business on the hook for a more finite period of time which may be an easier place for you to start before doing the
“all out” Service Guarantee above.
[Conditional] Credit-based Guarantee
What the Client Gets:
 
You give them back what they paid but in a credit toward any
 
service you offer.
My Take:
 
This is best used during an upsell process to seal the deal on a service they are
 
unsure they will like. They
already like what they have, you are trying to sell them 
more
 of that. Worst case, they can apply it to the thing they already like.
So it maintains goodwill with the customer.
