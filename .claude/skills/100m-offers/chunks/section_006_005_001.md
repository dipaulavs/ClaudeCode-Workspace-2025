VALUE OFFER: CREATING YOUR GRAND SLAM OFFER PART II: TRIM & STACK
“Cut! Cut! Cut!”
FRIENDS TO RACHEL GREEN IN FRIENDS
divided this chapter into two parts because it’s the meatiest section in the book. It’s also the most important. Without a
valuable product or service, the rest of the book won’t be as actionable
.
 We just covered all the problems we are going to
solve. The second half of making your offer is breaking down tactically what we are going to do/provide for our client. In
theory, we’d all love to fly out and live with our customers to fix their problems. In reality, that wouldn’t make a very scalable
business. We need our offer to be incredibly attractive 
and
 profitable.
That being said, if this is your first Grand Slam Offer, it’s important to over-deliver like crazy. Maybe flying out isn’t such
a bad idea in the beginning. Make some sales, then think about how to make it easier for your clients. You want them to think to
themselves, “I get all this, for only that?” In essence, you want them to perceive 
tremendous value
.
Everyone buys bargains. Some people just buy $100,000 things for only $10,000. That’s where we want to live: high
prices, but a 
steal
 for the value (like hopefully this book so far).
Sales to Fulfillment Continuum
In order to best absorb the notions of trimming and stacking, we need a mental reframe.
Enter the sales to fulfillment continuum.
Whenever you are building a business, you have a continuum between ease of fulfillment and ease of sales. If you lower
what you have to do, it increases how hard your product or service is to sell. If you do as much as possible, it makes your
product or service easy to sell but hard to fulfill because there’s more demand on your time investment. The trick, and the
ultimate goal, is to find a sweet spot where you sell something very well that’s also easy to fulfill.
I have always lived by the mantra, “Create flow. Monetize flow. Then add friction.” This means I generate demand 
first
.
Then, with my offer, I get them to say yes. Once I have people saying yes, then, and only then, will I add friction in my
marketing, or decide to offer 
less
 for the same price.
Practicality drives this practice. If you can’t get demand flowing in, then you have no idea whether what you have is good.
I’d rather do more for every customer and have cash flow coming in, then optimize my business but have zero cash flow
coming in after (and zero idea about what I need to adjust to better serve my customers).

Here’s a perfect example to drive this home. When I started Gym Launch, gym owners reached out asking me to help. They
needed so much help, I didn’t know where to start. But I wanted to make sure they got way more than they paid me. So here’s
what I ended up doing to fill their gyms: I would fly out to their gym for 21 days, spend my own money on hotels, car rentals,
eating out, advertising, generate the leads, work the leads, then sell for them. I would even do the first onboarding meeting with
clients to get them started. In short, I did 
everything
. I took on all the risk.
They only had to put down $500 to “reserve” their date, which I made refundable at the end of their launch. So they had 0
financial risk, 0 time risk, 0 effort, and the deal was, I got to keep all the up front cash collected from selling their services, and
they got clients for free. You can imagine how this was a pretty compelling offer.
On my own, I was able to sell about $100,000/mo in up front cash for myself. So these deals were very lucrative for me.
Over time, I scaled that to a team of 8 guys selling every month. But this began to wear on me and the team. It was at that point
that I realized that if I were to simply teach them how to do what I did, I could charge maybe a third of what I would normally
make, but I would be able to help hundreds of gyms a month instead of eight. And, I could do it all sleeping in my own bed
every night.
My promise was fundamentally the same: I will fill your gym in 30 days. It was simply the 
how
 and 
what I did
 that
changed. The 
how and what
 is what we are breaking apart.
When talking to business owners about their model, I tell them to create cash flow by over-delivering like crazy at first.
Then use the cash flow to fix your operations and make your business more efficient. This revision process can be pretty
seamless. You may not even have to change what you offer. You may just end up creating systems that create the same value for
the customer but cost you significantly less resources.
Ultimately this is how businesses beat one another. Understanding this will be important as you scale your business.
Now that we’ve established the importance of the fulcrum and how to approach the sales-fulfillment balance at the outset,
let’s cover the last two steps of creating our Grand Slam offer. To recap quickly, remember that we covered identifying dream
outcomes (step one), listing problems (step two), and determining solutions (step three)
.
