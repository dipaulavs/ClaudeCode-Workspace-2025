# Final Thoughts

**Path:** Section V: Execution/Final Thoughts
**Type:** conclusion

---

Entrepreneurship is about acquiring skills, beliefs, and character traits. To advance, I find that we must determine which
skills, beliefs, and character traits we 
lack
. Most times, we simply need to improve. And the only way to do that is through
learning from experience and/or high quality sources. I have received terrible advice from people who were ahead of me at the
time. And though experience is the 
best
 teacher, she is not the kindest.
It is my most sincere hope that what I produce provides the guidance I so desperately needed when I was coming up on my
entrepreneurial journey. And I wish I could cover it all in a single book (for my sake and yours). But, to do you the service I
wish I had had, I cannot. The devil is in the details. Excellence exists in the depth of knowledge and nuances. That’s what
separates the greats from everyone else. I hope that in all the content I produce you see my dedication to this detail and nuance
that makes 
all the difference
. These lessons were hard won.
I hope you’ve enjoyed this first volume in my offers series. Before we move forward into volume two, where we’ll be
focusing on lead generation, as mentioned above, I wanted to circle back to where we started. After reading this book, I hope:
1
. 
You’re well on the path to creating your first Grand Slam Offer. Or at the very least, can take components that you
were missing in your offer to make it more compelling to your market.
2
. 
I’ve delivered on my promise from the beginning of this book: that investing two to three hours of your time here
would yield you a far higher return than just about anything else you could do.
3
. 
I hope in return I’ve taken one small step towards earning the thing I value most from you -- 
your trust
.
Finally, I hope this book creates a small dent in improving the world because I believe no one is coming to save us. It’s up

to us, as entrepreneurs, to innovate our way into a better world. And that’s something I’m willing to devote my life to. And I
hope you are, too.
I’m grateful for your attention. You could have given it to anything, and you chose to invest it with me. I take it in high
regard. So, sincerely, thank you.
Stay hungry,
Alex

NEXT BOOK.

AUDIOBOOK.
 
If you like listening and having all your books with you to
 
reference (that’s what I do) you can grab the 
audible & kindle version of
any
 
or all my books on amazon. 
I like reading and listening at the same time to
 
increase my absorption & consumption speeds. Just search for the book
titles and they’ll both come up.

 Podcast called “The Game”
