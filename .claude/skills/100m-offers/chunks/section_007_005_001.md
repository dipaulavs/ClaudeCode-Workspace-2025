ENHANCING THE OFFER: GUARANTEES
“You’re gonna like the way you look...I guarantee it.”
M EN’S W AREHOUSE AD THAT RAN FOREVER.
he single greatest objection for any product or service being sold is...drum roll...
risk.
 Risk that it doesn’t do what it’s
supposed to do for them. Therefore, reversing risk is an immediate way to make any offer more attractive. You will want
to spend a disproportionate amount of time figuring out how you want to reverse it. That being said, how much more attractive
can a guarantee make an offer?
Jason Fladlien, who I referenced earlier, once stated that he had seen the conversion on an offer 2-4x simply by changing
the quality of the guarantee. It’s that important.
From an overarching perspective there are four types of guarantees:
1
. 
Unconditional
2
. 
Conditional
3
. 
Anti-Guarantee
4
. 
Implied Guarantees.
You must 
always
 hit your guarantee hard, even if you don't have one. Say it boldly and give the reason why.
But won’t people take advantage of a crazy guarantee?
Sometimes, but not usually. That being said, you must understand the math. If you close 130 percent as many people, and
your refund percentage 
doubles
 from 5 percent to 10 percent, you’ve still made 1.23x the money, or 23 percent more, and that
all goes to the bottom line.
Ex: 100 sales, 5 refunds (5%) = 95 Net Sales
Guarantee Offer 130 sales, 13 refunds (10%)= 117 Net sales
117/95 = 1.23x (23% increase)
Don't be emotional, just do the math. For a guarantee to 
not
 be worth it, the increase in sales would have to be 100 percent
offset by people who refunded. So an absolute increase in sales of 5 percent would need to be offset by an absolute increase in
refunds of 5 percent (but that might be a doubling of refunds, which is unlikely). So, for the most part, the stronger the
guarantee, the higher the 
net
 increase in total purchases, even if the refund rate increases alongside it.
Warning
: While guarantees can be effective sellers, people who buy 
because
 of guarantees can become very shitty
customers. A person who only buys because of a guarantee is a person who may not be willing to put in the work necessary to
see success with your product or service. In a world where you want to reverse risk 
and
 get customers the best outcome
possible, tying your guarantee to the things they need to do to be successful can help all parties.

Pro Tip: High Cost Services Warning
If you have a tremendous amount of cost associated with your product or service, you will likely want to employ a conditional guarantee or an ANTI
guarantee, as you will have to eat the cost of the refund AND the cost of fulfilling.
Types of Guarantees
What makes a guarantee have power is a conditional statement: If you do not get X result in Y time period, we will Z.
To give a guarantee 
teeth
 you have to decide what you’ll do if they 
don’t
 get the result.
Without the “or what” portion of the guarantee, it sounds weak and diluted.
Note
: This is what most marketers do.
Bad Example: We will get you 20 clients guaranteed.
Better example: You will get 20 clients in your first 30 days, or we give you your money back + your advertising dollars
spent with us. This is a simple, but strong guarantee.
Here are the four types of guarantees. I’ll go over them in theory then we will apply them.
1) Unconditional Guarantees
As I stated earlier, there are unconditional, conditional, and “anti-” guarantees. Unconditional are the strongest guarantees.
They're basically a trial where they pay first then see if they like it. This gets a LOT more people to buy, but you 
will
 have
some people refund, especially as consumer culture continues to shift towards entitlement and zero accountability.
2) Conditional Guarantees
Conditional guarantees include “terms and conditions” to the guarantee. These are the ones you can get VERY creative on.
In general, you want these to be “better than money back” guarantees. Because if they are going to make an investment, you
want to match their investment psychologically with an equal or higher perceived commitment. These also can have a 
very
powerful effect on getting clients results. If you know the key actions someone must take in order to be successful, make those
part of the conditional guarantee. In a perfect world, 100% of your customers would qualify for a conditional guarantee, but
will have achieved their result, and therefore will not want to take it. That is an ideal we can all aspire towards. And just fyi -
if given the option of getting a refund or getting the outcome they were promised the vast majority of people will take the
outcome.
3) Anti-Guarantees
Anti-guarantees are when you explicitly state “all sales are final.” You will want to own this position. You must come up
with a creative “reason why” the sales are final. Typically, you’ll want to show a massive exposure or vulnerability on your
part that a consumer could immediately understand and think “Yes, that makes sense.” These types of guarantees are especially
important with items that are consumable or massively diminish in value once given.
4) Implied Guarantees
Implied guarantees are any offer that is a performance-based offer. This comes in many different forms. Revshare,
profitshare, triggers, ratchets, monetary bonuses, etc are all examples. The end all concept is the same, if I don't perform, I
don’t get paid. Unique to this particular structure, it also confers the upside of “If I do a great job, I will be very well
compensated.” These only work in situations where you have transparency for measuring the outcome and trust (or control) that
you will get compensated when you do perform.
Stacking Guarantees
An experienced salesman understands that, like bonuses, you can actually 
stack
 guarantees. For example, you could give an
unconditional 30 day no questions asked guarantee then on top of that give a conditional triple your money back 90 day
guarantee. That would be an example of stacking an unconditional with a conditional guarantee.

You can also stack two conditional guarantees around different (or sequential) outcomes. For example, you’ll make
$10,000 by 60 days, $30,000 by 90 days as long as you do thing 1, 2, and 3. This future paces the prospect into an outcome
they now believe is far more likely (since you will be deliberately spelling it out in a conditional guarantee with a timeline for
achievement). Doing this shows the prospect you are serious about getting them results and convinced that they will achieve
what they want. This shifts the burden of risk back from them onto us...a very powerful strategy.
Let’s go through some different guarantee examples:
Guarantee: If you don’t achieve X, in Y time, we will [insert offer] . . .
