# Conditional Guarantees (Part 2) & Anti-Guarantees

**Path:** Section IV: Enhancing Your Offer/Chapter 15: Enhancing The Offer: Guarantees/Conditional Guarantees (Part 2) & Anti-Guarantees
**Type:** subsection

---

What the Client Gets:
 
You work with them one-on-one, free of charge, until they reach
 
X objective or result.
My Take:
 
This is absolutely one of the strongest guarantees in existence. It’s like a service guarantee on crack. You will
definitely
 want to add conditions, though: they must respond back in twenty-four hours, they must use the products you tell them
to, they must XYZ. Only if they do that, will you keep working with them one-on-one.
This is especially powerful as you scale and become more edified as a business owner. Can you imagine one of my sales
people saying, “Alex will personally work with you until your offer converts”? Right. It would work. It would also be a
nightmare. So I would probably put contingencies like, “Provided you've already spent $10,000 on your existing offer using
our structure, the offer you ran was for lead generation, and it was a free offer. These are things that would make it unlikely
they would not succeed. If for some reason they 
hadn’t
 with those stipulations in place, I could probably fix their problem in
ten minutes just looking at it.
[Conditional] Hotel + Airfare Perks Guarantee
What the Client Gets:
 
If you don't receive value, we will reimburse your product
 
and your
 
hotel + airfare.
My Take:
 
This is technically a “refund of ancillary costs” from our first example. I just
 
love it a lot for workshops and in-
person experiences. Normally the event would cost more than the hotel and airfare, so it's like adding an extra $1000 to a
guarantee but way more tangible. It’s original enough that people like it.
[Conditional] Wage-Payment Guarantee
What the Client Gets:
 
You offer to pay their hourly rate, whatever that may be, if they
 
don’t find your call/session with
them valuable.
My Take:
 
This is also an ancillary cost guarantee, just a very original one. If someone ever
 
actually asks for the wage
payment, just ask them for their tax return and divide it by 1,960 (number of working hours at 40hrs/wk for a year). But no one
asking for a refund will actually do that, so you will never actually have to give one of these out. Like ever.

[Conditional] Release of Service Guarantee
What the Client Gets:
 
You let them out of their contract free of charge.
My Take:
 
This voids a commitment or cancellation fee. If you have a business that has
 
enforceable commitments, contracts
or clauses, this can be a powerful guarantee. Better yet, if you are in a business that does not enforce your contracts, then you
have nothing to lose by adding the guarantee.
[Conditional] Delayed Second Payment Guarantee
What the Client Gets:
 
You won’t bill them again until
 
after
 
they make or get their first
 
outcome. Ex: Lose your first five
pounds . . . make your first sale . . . get your website live, etc.
My Take:
 
I like this a lot, especially if you have a very systematized process for getting the
 
first result. It gets the prospect
thinking in fast action terms and gets them moving. It will also focus your team on activating your client. This is a great one
when you know what metric or action drives activation (predicting indicator of long term retention) of a client.
I’ve successfully used this guarantee loads of times.
[Conditional] First Outcome Guarantee
What the Client Gets:
 
You continue to pay their ancillary costs (ad spend, hotel, etc) until they reach their first outcome.
Example: If you don’t make your first sale in 14 days, we will pay for your ad spend until you do.
My Take:
 
Just like the delayed second payment, just centered around a different cost. I
 
personally like this setup a lot. It
keeps everyone focused on getting that first dollar over the bridge. Once that one comes across, the second comes soon after.
[Anti-Guarantee] All Sales Are Final
What the Client Gets:
 
Access to super exclusive very valuable service/product. Likely,
 
this is a very powerful thing that
once seen cannot be unseen, or once used cannot be taken away. Example: a line of code to improve your checkout experience
on a website. Once someone received this code, they could try and use it without paying you. Or a series of opening messages
for picking up girls, or opening sentences for messaging cold prospects. Things that are very valuable but incredibly easy to
steal after they’ve been seen/understood.
My Take:
 
This can enhance the persuasiveness of the sale and the value of the product or
 
service. It essentially 
implies
that the client is going to use it and see an immense benefit thereby exposing the business to vulnerability. It acts as a damaging
admission. We have an “all sales are final” policy, 
but
 that is because our product is so exclusive and so powerful that once
used it cannot be unused.” Since it is so standard to have some sort of guarantee, not having one is attention-worthy.
So instead of being wishy-washy, lean into the fact this thing works so well, and is so easy to copy, you 
must
 make all sales
final. They’ll believe you even more if you take this position. “We are going to show you our proprietary process that we are
using right now to generate leads in our business. Our funnels, ads, and metrics. We’re going to be exposing the inner workings
of our business, as a result, all sales are final.” Note: strong reason why is needed here. Just make one up that sounds
compelling. The more you can show 
real
 exposure, the more effective this will be.
Anti-guarantees can also work very well with high ticket products and services that require a lot of work or customization.
“If you're the type of customer who needs a guarantee before taking a jump, then you are not the type of person we want to work
with. We want motivated self-starters who can follow instructions and are not looking for a way out before they even begin. If
you are not serious, don’t buy it. But if you are, boy are you going to make a killing. ” From these examples, you should get the
idea.

from baseline

Ratchets: 
10% if over X, 20% if over Y, 30% if over Z
Bonuses/Triggers
: I get X when Y occurs.
What The Client Gets
: 
If you do not perform, they do not have to pay. If you perform,
 
your compensation has been
determined based on an agreement decided upon 
before
 you begin working.
My Take
: 
Performance, Revshare, and Profit-shares aren’t guarantees “per se”, but for all
 
intents and purposes, they are.
There is an implied guarantee whenever you enter into a revshare or performance partnership: if you dont make money, you
don't have to pay me. In my opinion, this is one of, if not THE most desirable setup. First because it makes you accountable to
your clients' results. Second it weeds out low performers. Perfect alignment between client and service provider fosters
collaboration and a long-term relationship. I'm a big fan. The drawbacks are tracking and collection. So if you can find a way
around that...you’ve hit a gold mine. This is a part of the offer we teach our agencies who use our software. We help them
switch from a retainer model to a performance model and wrap that into the Grand Slam Offer I walked through earlier. I've
seen countless agencies go from $20k/mo to $200k+/mo in a matter of a few months.
You can also pair a revshare or performance setup with a minimum. It would be like saying “we get the greater of $1000 or
10% of revenue generated.” So if the client doesn’t generate money because of whatever reason this at least covers your costs
of services etc.
Or saying we get $1000/mo for the first 3 months, then after that, it switches to 100% performance. This would be ideal for
a setup that takes a lot of time to get going.
These types of offers work well when you have quantifiable outcomes. The stronger, of course, is no guaranteed payment
without performance.
Create Your Own Winning Guarantee
Reversing risk is the number one way to increase the conversion of an offer. Experienced marketers spend as much time
crafting their guarantees as the deliverables themselves. It’s that important.
I have personally used all the guarantees listed above (except for the hotel and phone call one, which I just saw and liked).
But you can come up with your own! The key is to identify a client’s biggest fears, pain, and perceived obstacles. “What do
they 
not
 want to have happen if they pay you? What are they most afraid of?” Reverse their fears into a guarantee. Think of the
time, emotion, and outside costs associated with any program or service. The more specific and creative the guarantee is, the
better.
That being said, guarantees are enhancers. They can enhance the magnetism or attraction of any offer, but they cannot make
a business. If a guarantee is used to cover up a poor sales team or a poor product, it will backfire into lots of refunds. No
bueno.
My advice: Start selling service-based guarantees or setting up performance partnerships. This will make all sales final (so
no fear from refunds). Most importantly, it will commit you to your customers’ results and keep you honest. From there, either
keep that guarantee and scale (perfectly fine), or move up the food chain to less restrictive guarantees to increase volume.
We now have a core offer built and guarantees chosen.
Next Up...
Now all we have to do is put a bow on this puppy and actually name it. Naming an offer correctly determines how well
your advertising converts, how big of a response you get from outbound emails/cold calls/texts, and how many inbound
responses you get from organic comments.
It matters.
That being said, I will show you how to generate unlimited names or “wrapping paper” for your offer. That way it never
fatigues, no matter how small your market may be. This is the key to evergreen lead generation.
