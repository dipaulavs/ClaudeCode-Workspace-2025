Now that we have enumerated our potential solutions, we will have a gigantic list. Next, I look at the cost of providing
these solutions to me (the business). I remove the ones that are high cost and low value first. Then I remove low cost, low
value items.
If you aren’t sure what’s high value, go through the value equation and ask yourself which of these things will this person:
1
. 
Financially value
2
. 
Cause them to believe they will be likely to succeed
3
. 
Make them feel like they can do it with much less effort and sacrifice
4
. 
Help them accomplish their goal and see the result they want with far less time investment.
What should remain are offer items that are 1) low cost, high value and 2) high cost, high value.
Example
: 
Let’s say I moved in with someone and did their shopping, exercising, and
 
cooking for them. They would
probably believe they would definitely lose weight. But I am not willing to do that for any amount of money short of a gazillion
dollars.
The next question becomes, is there a lesser version of this experience that I can deliver at scale?
Just take one step back at a time until you arrive at something that has a time commitment or cost you are willing to live
with (or, obviously, massively increase your price so it becomes worth it for you — i.e., the gazillion dollars to live with
someone).
If there’s 
one
 type of delivery vehicle to focus on, it’s creating high value, “one to many” solutions. These will be the ones
that typically have the biggest discrepancy between cost and value. For example, before I started my first gym, I had an online
training business. I created a small excel sheet application that after inputting all of someone’s goals, automatically generated
over 100 meals perfectly suited to their macronutrient and calorie needs. Better yet, depending which meals they selected,
would tell them what they needed to buy at the grocery store in exact amounts, 
and
 how to prepare them in bulk for their exact
amounts. It took me about 100 hours to put the whole thing together. But from that point going forward I sold truly personalized
eating plans for very expensive prices, but they only took me about 15minutes to make. High value. Low cost.
These types of solutions require a high, one-time cost of creation, but infinitely low additional effort after. (Fyi - This is
exactly why software becomes so valuable).
That doesn’t mean you don’t ever want to do something in a small group or one-on-one model. After all, I do 1-on-1 with
all of my portfolio company CEOs that we help scale past $30m+. You just want to make sure you save those high cost items
for 
big
 value adds only. If you think you can accomplish the same value with a lower cost alternative, then do that instead.
When I was running my gym, I went through this exercise and created: bulking blueprints, an eating-out system, a travel
eating and workout guide, meal plans for every bodyweight and gender, a grocery list calculator, plateau busting meal plans
(for when they got stuck), fast cooking guides partnered with meal prep services, and did in-person nutrition orientations with
every client one-on-one.
Many of the “one to many” solutions require more up front work. Once created, however, they become valuable assets that
create value in perpetuity. It’s worth putting in the time to create these because they will create high margin profit for years to
come.
Real talk: the meal plans I made for my gym have been used by 4,000+ gyms now and literally hundreds of thousands of

people. They are simple and easy to follow. So they have provided ample return for the week or two of dedicated time I spent
making them.
And if you ever have the desire to build a repeatable business model, something that scales, these assets you create will
become the bedrock. This book, for example, is a high-value asset that is low cost overall. Sure, it costs me a lot up front, but
each additional book I sell after my first one costs me very little and provides tremendous value.
The Final High Value Deliverable
Let’s sum this up before we configure our final high value deliverable.
Step #1: 
We figured out our prospective client's dream outcome.
Step #2: 
We listed out all the obstacles they’re likely to encounter on their way (our
 
opportunities for value).
Step #3: 
We listed all those obstacles as solutions.
Step #4: 
We figured out all the different ways we could deliver those solutions.
Step #5a: 
We trimmed those ways down to only the things that were the highest value
 
and lowest cost to us.
All we have to do now 
is…
Step #5b: 
Put all the bundles together into the ultimate high value deliverable.
So let’s go back to the example. We see our prospects struggled with the following:

Author Note
Most of our facilities now sell this bundle for longer periods of time for $2,400 to $5,200. 
Wild
. As we got better at creating and monetizing value, the
prices and profit of our facilities skyrocketed. Once you start down this value creation process, each additional piece of value you create stacks on top over
time. This is why it is important to begin.
Can you see how much more valuable this is than a gym membership? 
The bundle does three core
 
things:
1
. 
Solves 
all
 the perceived problems (not just some)
2
. 
Gives you the conviction that what you’re selling is one of a kind (very important)
3
. 
Makes it impossible to compare or confuse your business or offering with the one down the street
Whew! We finally have what we are going to deliver in all its glory. That being said, it is unlikely we would present it in
this way. Depending on whether we sell one on one or one to many, we would present this differently. I will address how to
present each of these bundled items in the bonus section (next section).
Summary Points
We went through this entire process to accomplish one objective: to create a valuable offer that is differentiated and unable
to be compared to anything else in the marketplace. We are selling something unique. As such, we are no longer bound by the
normal pricing forces of commoditization. Prospects will now only make a 
value-based
 rather than a 
price-based 
decision on
whether they should buy from us. Hoorah!
Now that we have our core offer, the next section will be dedicated to 
enhancing
 it. We will employ a combination of
psychological levers: bonuses, urgency, scarcity, guarantees, and naming.
