# Step 4: Create Your Solutions Delivery Vehicles

The next step is thinking about all the things you could 
do
 to solve each of these problems you’ve identified. This is the
most important step in this process. This is what you are going to 
deliver
. This is what you are going to do or provide in
exchange for money.
For the purposes of keeping creativity high (divergent thinking), think about 
anything you
 
could possibly do
. Think of all
the things that might enhance the value of your offer. So much
 
so that they would be stupid to say no.
What could you do that someone would immediately say, “All that? Seriously? Yes, I'm in.”
Doing this exercise will make your job of selling So. Much. Easier.
Even if you come up with something you’re not actually willing to do, it’s okay. The goal here is to push your limits and jog
your brain into thinking of a different version of the solution you’d normally default to. This is where you get to flex your
entrepreneurial creativity.
Reminder
: You only need to do this
 
once
. Literally
 
one time
 
for a product that may last
 
years. This is high-value, high-
leverage work. You ultimately get paid for 
thinking
. You got this. This should be fun. Go ahead and list out all your
possibilities now. Then I’ll take you through my example. I’ll just use the buying food problem from earlier as an example. I
like to group things by how many people I'm going to deliver this thing to at once.
My list is below. And at the bottom, I’ve given you my “cheat codes” for how I think through this to get even more creative.
Problem: Buying Healthy Food Is Hard, Confusing, and I Won’t Like It
If I wanted to provide a one-on-one solution I might offer . . .
1
. 
In-person grocery shopping, where I take clients to the store and teach them how to shop
2
. 
Personalized grocery list, where I teach them how to make their list
3
. 
Full-service shopping, where I buy their food for them. We’re talking 100 percent done for them.
4
. 
In-person orientation (not at store), where I teach them what to get

5
. 
Text support while shopping, where I help them if they get stuck
6
. 
Phone call while grocery shopping, where I plan to call when they go shopping to provide direction and support
If I wanted to provide a small group solution I might offer . . .
1
. 
In-person grocery shopping, where I meet a bunch of people and take them all shopping for themselves
2
. 
Personalized grocery list, where I teach a bunch of people how to make their weekly lists. I could do this one time
or every week if I wanted to.
3
. 
Buy their food for them, where I purchase their groceries and deliver them as well
4
. 
In-person orientation, where I teach a small group offsite what to do (not at store)
If I wanted to provide a one to many solution I might offer . . .
1
. 
Live grocery tour virtual, where I might live stream me going through the grocery store for all my new customers
and let them ask questions live
2
. 
Recorded grocery tour, where I might shop once, record it, then give it as a reference point from that point onwards
for my clients to watch on their own
3
. 
DIY grocery calculator, where I create a shareable tool or show them how to use a tool to calculate their grocery
list
4
. 
Predetermined lists, where each customer plan comes with its own grocery list for each week. I could make this
ahead of time so they have it. Then they could use it on their own time
5
. 
Grocery buddy system, where I could pair customers all up, which takes no time really, and let them go shopping
together
6
. 
Pre-made, insta-cart grocery carts for delivery, where I could pre-make insta-cart lists so clients could have their
groceries delivered to their doorstep with one click
As you see, the list can really go on and on here. This is just to illustrate the many ways to solve a 
single
 problem.
Now do this for 
all
 of the perceived problems that your clients encounter before, after, and during their experience with
your service/products. You should have a monster list by the end of this.
Product Delivery Cheat Codes
What’s that? You’re having trouble being creative? I'm going to give you the cheat codes right now, kind of like I did with
the brick example: “the brick could be gold, or plastic, or have holes in it, or be a lego, etc.” Here are my “cheat codes” for
product variation/enhancement and a visual to break down the process for you from my consulting deck:

1
. 
What level of personal attention do I want to provide?
 one-on-one, small group, one to many
2
. 
What level of effort is expected from them?
 Do it themselves (DIY) - figure out how to do it on their own; do it
with them (DWY) - you teach them how to do it; done for them (DFY) - you do it for them
3
. 
If doing something
 
live
, what environment or medium do I want to deliver it in?
 In-person, phone support, email
support, text support, Zoom support, chat support
4
. 
If doing a recording, how do I want them to consume it?
 Audio, video, or written.
5
. 
How quickly do we want to reply? On what days? during what hours?
 24/7. 9-5, within 5 minutes, within an hour,
within 24 hrs?
6
. 
10x to 1/10
th
 
test.
 If my customers paid me 10x my price (or $100,000) what would I provide? If they paid me
1/10
th
 the price and I had to make my product more valuable than it already is, how would I do that? How could I
still make them successful for 1/10
th
 price? Stretch your mind in either direction and you’ll come up with widely
different solutions.
In other words, how could I actually 
deliver
 on these solutions I am claiming I will provide. Do this for each problem
because solutions from one problem will give you ideas for others you wouldn’t normally have considered.
Remember, it’s important that you solve 
every
 problem. I can’t tell you the amount of times 
one
 single item becomes the
reason someone doesn't buy.
Anecdote: Why We Must Solve 
Every
 Perceived Problem
When I was selling weight loss, I insisted that folks prepare all their food at home. I found it too difficult to help clients lose weight when they ate out
because they always blew their diets. Rather than solve the problem, I insisted they do it my way, or not at all. As a result, I lost many sales.
One month I really needed to make some sales to pay rent. My next sale walked in the door - it was a business exec looking to lose weight. As we got
into the sales presentation, she told me the program wouldn’t work for her because she went out to eat for lunch everyday. Normally, I would have lost this
sale. I was a stickler for making people 
not
 eat out. But I really 
needed
 the money. Refusing to lose the sale because of this 
one thing
, I conceded “I’ll
make you an eating out guide for when you go to restaurants so you can eat our 100 percent of the time and still hit your goal. How does that sound?” She
agreed, and I closed the sale.

I took the time to make an eating out guide for her. But from that point going forward, whenever someone said “but what about eating out??” I had the
solution. Over time, I continued solving obstacles with templates and trainings until there were no more “
one things”
 to prevent my sales. This lesson has
stuck with me to this day. Don’t get romantic about 
how
 you want to solve the problem. Find a way to solve every problem a prospect presents with. When
you do that, you make an offer that’s so good, people just can't say no. And that’s what we’re building here.
Note: You must resolve every obstacle a buyer believes they will have to convert the highest amount of people. That’s not to say that if you don't, you
won’t sell people. Not at all. But you won't sell 
as many people as you otherwise could have
. And that’s the goal, to sell the most people, for the highest
possible price, with the highest possible margin.
